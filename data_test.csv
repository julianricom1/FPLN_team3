1,"'Henry Beller was for many years toast-master at various corporation
dinners, during which time he drank a great deal of foreign wine; may
sometimes have carried a bottle or two home with him; is not quite
certain of that, but is sure if he did, that he drank the contents."
2,"You have a brother; you know it, and
him.
There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret
and the gain to you at her own death."
3,"Come, come; say
you wouldn’t.”
“Well, then,” rejoined Mr. Sikes, “I wouldn’t."
4,"'What, Sammy!'
exclaimed the father.
'What, old Nobs!'"
5,"He
laughed heartily at my feeble portrait of that gentleman, and said he
was a man to know, and he must know him."
6,"I
think the Church-rates guesses who I am, and I know the Water-works
does, because I drew a tooth of his when I first came down here."
7,"They took another quart apiece to drink each
other's health in, and were staunch friends ever afterwards."
8,"“What foolery
are you up to, now, again?
Get up and bustle about, and don’t come over
me with your woman’s nonsense.”
At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was
delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really
weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and
fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths
with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his
threats."
9,"'Allow me the H-onour,' said the gentleman with the whiskers, presenting
his dexter hand, and aspirating the h.
'With much pleasure, sir,' said Mr. Pickwick; and having executed a very
long and solemn shake, he got into bed again."
10,"Ain’t
it beautiful?”
Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of
Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to
that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder."
11,"The table was
adorned with piles of papers; and above the farther end of it, appeared
the head and shoulders of Mr. Jinks, who was busily engaged in looking
as busy as possible."
12,"Tongue--, well that's
a wery good thing when it ain't a woman's."
13,"Accordingly I was called out of school next forenoon, and
found Mr. Micawber in the parlour; who had called to say that the dinner
would take place as proposed."
14,"'It's hardly to be borne,' said the prim man, looking round."
15,"Never was such
a contest known.
The Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall, was the
Blue candidate; and Horatio Fizkin, Esq., of Fizkin Lodge, near
Eatanswill, had been prevailed upon by his friends to stand forward on
the Buff interest."
16,"A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.
It was tolling for the funeral service."
17,"She smiled at this, Samivel,' said
the old gentleman, stifling a sigh with his pipe, 'but she died arter
all!'"
18,"Here Mr. Perker
drew himself up with conscious dignity, and brushed some stray grains of
snuff from his shirt frill."
19,"“Wo—o!” said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.
The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably,
whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when
he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was
laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward."
20,"Well, Ramsey tried to speak, but
Fogg wouldn't let him, so he put the money in his pocket, and sneaked
out."
21,"When this despondency was at its worst, I believed that I should die."
22,"“He’s been in good training these last
few weeks, and it’s time he began to work for his bread."
23,"Ain’t that lucky?
Come on, little ‘un, and let’s see
who’ll get most.’
The waiter certainly got most."
24,"Can I live anywhere
else?
I thought I could not.'
At this inquiry Mr. Martin looked, with a countenance of excessive
surprise, at his two friends, and then each gentleman pointed with his
right thumb over his left shoulder."
25,"‘Theer!’ said Mr. Peggotty, cheerily.
‘Theer we are, Missis Gummidge!’
Mrs. Gummidge slightly groaned."
26,"He left her so little leisure for being
miserable, that she said next day she thought she must have been
bewitched."
27,"The noise of wheels and tread of people were as hushed, as
if the streets had been strewn that depth with feathers."
28,"'What's the matter?'
was the general inquiry.
'Nobody dead, is there?'"
29,The door was no sooner opened than all doubt on the subject was removed.
30,"'I should, if their aunt wasn't here,' replied the ready Pickwickian,
with a passionate glance."
31,"'So shall I,' said Mr. Alfred Jingle, drawing one arm through Mr.
Pickwick's, and another through Mr. Wardle's, as he whispered
confidentially in the ear of the former gentleman:--
'Devilish good dinner--cold, but capital--peeped into the room this
morning--fowls and pies, and all that sort of thing--pleasant fellows
these--well behaved, too--very.'"
32,"said Mr. Dowler, looking meeker than Mr. Winkle had expected in
a gentleman of his ferocity."
33,"The bell did ring in due course, and Mr. Weller presented himself.
'Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, looking out from under the bed-clothes."
34,"I am sure Uriah held his.
‘“First,”’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘“When Mr. W.’s faculties and memory
for business became, through causes into which it is not necessary or
expedient for me to enter, weakened and confused,--HEEP--designedly
perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions."
35,"'I was, sir,' replied Job, heaving a deep sigh; 'I was the idol of the
place.'"
36,"I appealed; the case come on before
three or four very sleepy gentlemen, who had heard it all before in the
other court, where they're lawyers without work; the only difference
being, that, there, they're called doctors, and in the other place
delegates, if you understand that; and they very dutifully confirmed the
decision of the old gentleman below."
37,"A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose
listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency
to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked
sternly up to bid some woman “Take that baby out,” when the gravity of
justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother’s
shawl, from some meagre infant."
38,"He put on his hat and walked quickly down
the garden, determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom."
39,"Her colour still came
and went, but she breathed more freely.
I thought I knew why."
40,"The ground opened beneath the prince's feet;
he sank into the chasm; and instantaneously it closed upon his head for
ever, save where his hot tears welled up through the earth, and where
they have continued to gush forth ever since."
41,"The Jew saw that it would be
hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss
Nancy’s rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a
glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that
he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue."
42,"Here, Tommy, dear.'
'Well,' said Master Bardell.
'Who else is a-goin', lovey?'"
43,"Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a
summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the
character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty’s subjects, especially of
the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic
tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are
closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily
press."
44,"He got up to ascertain if the door were
close shut, before he replied, in a lower voice:
‘My dear Copperfield, a man who labours under the pressure of pecuniary
embarrassments, is, with the generality of people, at a disadvantage."
45,"He
held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.
“Give me the other,” said Sikes, seizing Oliver’s unoccupied hand."
46,"'""Under favour, Sir,"" replied the horror-stricken sexton, ""I don't think
they can, Sir; they don't know me, Sir; I don't think the gentlemen have
ever seen me, Sir."""
47,"Mr. Weller was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence that he
found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for
support; and divers little love passages had passed between them, before
he was sufficiently collected to return to the subject."
48,"And now, as I close my task, subduing my desire to linger yet, these
faces fade away."
49,"Miss Lavinia, self-charged with the superintendence of my
darling’s wardrobe, is constantly cutting out brown-paper cuirasses, and
differing in opinion from a highly respectable young man, with a long
bundle, and a yard measure under his arm."
50,"‘Sir,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘she is also, thank God, in statu quo.’
‘And the children, Mr. Micawber?’
‘Sir,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘I rejoice to reply that they are, likewise,
in the enjoyment of salubrity.’
All this time, Mr. Micawber had not known me in the least, though he
had stood face to face with me."
51,"Mr. Tupman no sooner heard this avowal, than he proceeded to do what his
enthusiastic emotions prompted, and what, for aught we know (for we are
but little acquainted with such matters), people so circumstanced always
do."
52,"My eyes, however, not being so much under control as my tongue, were
attracted towards my aunt very often during breakfast."
53,"They can’t be born, unless it’s pretty nigh
in--not properly born, till flood."
54,"The door being
opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one
side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box,
dismounted too, and stood upon the other side."
55,"Little Agnes, attracted by his looks, had run to
bring him in, and I had not yet clearly seen his face, when my wife,
starting up, cried out to me, in a pleased and agitated voice, that it
was Mr. Peggotty!"
56,"It was not on that evening; but, as I well remember, on the next evening
but one, which was a Sunday; that I took Agnes to see Dora."
57,"“Do name it, sir,” says Joram.
“Yes, do, father,” says
Minnie."
58,"Steerforth laughed heartily, and I laughed too.
Miss Mowcher continuing
all the time to shake her head (which was very much on one side), and to
look into the air with one eye, and to wink with the other."
59,"And the ladies,’ observed Mr. Chillip, timorously, ‘are
great observers, sir.’
‘I suppose she was to be subdued and broken to their detestable mould,
Heaven help her!’ said I."
60,"My employer--’
Here Mr. Micawber provokingly left off; and began to peel the lemons
that had been under my directions set before him, together with all the
other appliances he used in making punch."
61,"The meal was hastily
despatched; each of the gentlemen's hats was decorated with an enormous
blue favour, made up by the fair hands of Mrs. Pott herself; and as Mr.
Winkle had undertaken to escort that lady to a house-top, in the
immediate vicinity of the hustings, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Pott repaired
alone to the Town Arms, from the back window of which, one of Mr.
Slumkey's committee was addressing six small boys and one girl, whom he
dignified, at every second sentence, with the imposing title of 'Men of
Eatanswill,' whereat the six small boys aforesaid cheered prodigiously."
62,"I told him that my old nurse would be delighted to assist him, and that
we would all three take the field together, but on one condition."
63,"I saw that a crisis was at hand, and it came.
He clattered
all his means and implements together, rose from his chair, pulled out
his pocket-handkerchief, and burst into tears."
64,"It was altogether such an
astonishing event to see her do it!
I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping
house, than I and my pretty Dora did."
65,"I
have remarked that at those times, and when he is least like himself, he
is most certain to be wanted on some business.’
‘By Uriah,’ said Agnes."
66,"We'll usher him in with a merry din That
shall gladden his joyous heart, And we'll keep him up, while there's
bite or sup, And in fellowship good, we'll part."
67,"‘Now, Mr. Dick,’ said my aunt, with her grave look, and her forefinger
up as before, ‘I am going to ask you another question."
68,"That I truly devoted myself to it with my strongest
earnestness, and bestowed upon it every energy of my soul, I have
already said."
69,"I mentioned two o’clock in the afternoon as the
hour of our coming, and I sent the letter myself by the first coach in
the morning."
70,"As soon as she came nearly
below the tree, Sam began, by way of gently indicating his presence, to
make sundry diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be
natural to a person of middle age who had been afflicted with a
combination of inflammatory sore throat, croup, and whooping-cough, from
his earliest infancy."
71,"little
did Mr. Spenlow imagine, when he sat opposite to me after dinner that
day, with his pocket-handkerchief over his head, how fervently I was
embracing him, in my fancy, as his son-in-law!"
72,"'What's the matter?'
'You're wanted, Sir.'
'Who wants me?'"
73,"Signed upon oath, Tony Veller, Esquire.
That's
the last vun as was issued, Sammy,' replied Mr. Weller, untying his
shawl."
74,"In the adjoining
room, some solitary tenant might be seen poring, by the light of a
feeble tallow candle, over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers,
yellow with dust and dropping to pieces from age, writing, for the
hundredth time, some lengthened statement of his grievances, for the
perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach, or whose
heart it would never touch."
75,"It is the fate of all authors or chroniclers to create
imaginary friends, and lose them in the course of art."
76,"I should have committed murder—I
know I should—if we’d caught one of them rascals.”
As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as
their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued
upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament."
77,"'Have you any idea who the object of it might be?'
asked Mr. Winkle,
with great trepidation."
78,"He was the first boy who returned.
He introduced himself
by informing me that I should find his name on the right-hand corner of
the gate, over the top-bolt; upon that I said, ‘Traddles?’ to which he
replied, ‘The same,’ and then he asked me for a full account of myself
and family."
79,"All the rest of that day, and from
morning to night afterwards, she sat at that desk, scratching composedly
with a hard pen, speaking in the same imperturbable whisper to
everybody; never relaxing a muscle of her face, or softening a tone of
her voice, or appearing with an atom of her dress astray."
80,"“But you can’t do all that, dear,” said Charlotte."
81,"'Now, then!'
said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust his head
in at the door, 'what do you want, young man?'"
82,"‘It’s a load off my mind, Trotwood, to have such a partner.’
The red fox made him say all this, I knew, to exhibit him to me in the
light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest."
83,"“Come in, come in,” said the old lady: “I knew we should hear of him."
84,"“Not a bit of it,” replied Sikes, interposing.
“He’s used to it."
85,"These vigorous measures struck such
terror to the breast of Mrs. Crupp, that she subsided into her own
kitchen, under the impression that my aunt was mad."
86,"My dear old Traddles has tried his hand at the same pursuit, but it
is not in Traddles’s way."
87,"'No,' replied Mr. Snodgrass; and a tear trembled on his sentimental
eyelid, like a rain-drop on a window-frame--'no; he is not ill.'
Mr. Pickwick stopped, and gazed on each of his friends in turn."
88,"She
fell sick.
She dragged her tottering limbs from the bed to visit her son
once more, but her strength failed her, and she sank powerless on the
ground."
89,"I am not the last boy in the school.
I have risen in a few months, over
several heads."
90,"‘That is about Miss Wickfield’s time, is it not?’
‘A little earlier."
91,"With perfectly silent laughter.
Not
a sound escaped from him.
I was so repelled by his odious behaviour,
particularly by this concluding instance, that I turned away without any
ceremony; and left him doubled up in the middle of the garden, like a
scarecrow in want of support."
92,"He ruminated
a little with a most disturbed expression of face, and left the room in
search of Mary."
93,"Droll, droll, very droll.'
Here Mr. Pickwick smiled again, a
broader smile than before, and was about to continue the process of
undressing, in the best possible humour, when he was suddenly stopped by
a most unexpected interruption: to wit, the entrance into the room of
some person with a candle, who, after locking the door, advanced to the
dressing-table, and set down the light upon it."
94,"With this
view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then,
applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:
“Oliver!”
“Come; you let me out!” replied Oliver, from the inside."
95,"It was right that I should pay the forfeit of
my headlong passion.
What I reaped, I had sown."
96,"“You wouldn’t mind it again, Tom, would you,” asked the Dodger, winking
upon Charley and the Jew, “if Bet was all right?”
“I mean to say that I shouldn’t,” replied Tom, angrily."
97,"I worked down the wery
day arter the night as you caught the rheumatic, and at the Black Boy at
Chelmsford--the wery place they'd come to--I took 'em up, right through
to Ipswich, where the man-servant--him in the mulberries--told me they
was a-goin' to put up for a long time.'"
98,"But one obvious course
was left.
To borrow, of that branch of my family, the money to return to
London, and to return at any sacrifice.’
‘Then you all came back again, ma’am?’ I said."
99,"The cobbler’s been,’ he said, ‘since you’ve been out, Mr. Mell,
and he says he can’t mend ‘em any more."
100,"'Friend of yours, sir?'
'Not exactly a friend,' replied Mr. Pickwick, in a low tone."
101,"inquired Sam, with a smile.
'You,' replied Mr. Pickwick.
'Wery good, Sir.'"
102,"They made a bet
of a new hat before they had known each other half an hour, who should
brew the best quart of punch and drink it the quickest."
103,"“Lor, Noah!” said Charlotte, “what a rum creature you are!"
104,"‘My dear young friend,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘I am older than you; a man
of some experience in life, and--and of some experience, in short, in
difficulties, generally speaking."
105,"And you have the goodness to
come this here way, sir, if you please.'"
106,"One timid look
around—one moment’s pause of hesitation—he had closed it behind him,
and was in the open street."
107,"Our appearance
in a shop was a signal for the damaged goods to be brought out
immediately."
108,"Then came the dessert and some more toasts.
Then came the tea and coffee; and then, the ball."
109,"‘There, Peggotty,’ said my mother, changing her tone, ‘don’t let us fall
out with one another, for I couldn’t bear it."
110,"The
man was sixty, by years, and Heaven knows how old by imprisonment, so
that his having any look approaching to mirth or contentment, was
singular enough."
111,"They were both upright in their
carriage, formal, precise, composed, and quiet."
112,"I could only be
happy--by forgetting of her--and I’m afeerd I couldn’t hardly bear as
she should be told I done that."
113,"Agnes and hospitality
prevailed, however, and I conducted him to my fireside."
114,"I am afraid we present opportunities to
people to do wrong, that never ought to be presented."
115,"Great, rambling queer old places they are, with
galleries, and passages, and staircases, wide enough and antiquated
enough to furnish materials for a hundred ghost stories, supposing we
should ever be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any, and
that the world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable
veracious legends connected with old London Bridge, and its adjacent
neighbourhood on the Surrey side."
116,"I dwelt upon the fact
that Sophy--who I do assure you, Copperfield, is the dearest girl!--’
‘I am certain she is!’ said I."
117,"The driver stopped beside me, and my aunt was
sitting in it alone."
118,"“She is looking down, and
the candle is behind her.”
“Stay there,” whispered Fagin."
119,"I’ve been into his room already,
and we’ve made it all smooth."
120,"May he never leave us but to better
himself, and may his success among us be such as to render his bettering
himself impossible!” The cheering with which the toast was received
defies description."
121,"We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty,
who used to whisper of an evening when we sat, lovingly, on our little
locker side by side, ‘Lor!"
122,"He had a tree on his right, a tree on his
left, a third before him, and a fourth behind."
123,"I used to breakfast with
them now, in virtue of some arrangement, of which I have forgotten
the details."
124,"I did not approach her solitary figure without trembling;
for this gloomy end to her determined walk, and the way in which she
stood, almost within the cavernous shadow of the iron bridge, looking
at the lights crookedly reflected in the strong tide, inspired a dread
within me."
125,"Somebody wanted to recall the name of a place in
Devonshire, and only Sophy knew it."
126,"At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,
and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave."
127,"His deportment would have been fierce in a
butcher or a brandy-merchant.
The voice of the youthful servant became faint, but she seemed to me,
from the action of her lips, again to murmur that it would be attended
to immediate."
128,"They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards
the lights which he had seen before."
129,"Trot, come and take
it away from him!’
Whether my aunt supposed, for the moment, that he kept her property in
his neck-kerchief, I am sure I don’t know; but she certainly pulled at
it as if she thought so."
130,"‘You’ve come from The Willing Mind,
Dan’l?’
‘Why yes, I’ve took a short spell at The Willing Mind tonight,’ said Mr.
Peggotty."
131,"The most, however, was nothing at all; so, after a
profound silence of some minutes' duration, he said,--
'Serpent, Sir!"
132,"But it didn’t hurt him.
On the contrary, I
thought he seemed the fresher for it."
133,"It gave me no manner of concern that Steerforth should find
me a novice in these sciences, but I never could bear to show my want of
skill before the respectable Littimer."
134,"Having described the precise situation of the
office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk
straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off
his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on
alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting."
135,"“There’s a good
deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running
round the corner.”
“Don’t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?” asked Noah,
shaking his head."
136,"'I hope not,' replied Bob Sawyer, 'else where's the use of appearances,
eh?"
137,"When I returned, Mr. Wickfield had come home, from a garden he had, a
couple of miles or so out of town, where he now employed himself almost
every day."
138,"‘It’s very possible.
Or,
she may have had assistance from the boatmen, and the boatmen’s wives
and children."
139,"I took the liberty of representing
that we had been patient for a good many years; and that the
circumstance of Sophy’s being extraordinarily useful at home, ought not
to operate with her affectionate parents, against her establishment in
life--don’t you see?’
‘Certainly it ought not,’ said I."
140,"We
are positively corrupting people.
We are bound to think of that.
I can’t
help thinking of it, Dora."
141,"If I am a plaything for you
giants, be gentle with me.’
Miss Mowcher replaced her handkerchief in her pocket, looking at me with
very intent expression all the while, and pursued:
‘I saw you in the street just now."
142,"It won't
do no good, this won't.'
'Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick reproachfully."
143,"What’s that game at forfeits?
I love my love with an E, because
she’s enticing; I hate her with an E, because she’s engaged."
144,"“Keep back!
Damn you, keep back, if
you’ve a life to lose!”
“Nonsense, my good man,” said the undertaker, who was pretty well used
to misery in all its shapes."
145,"Mr. Pickwick had been so fully occupied in falling about, and
disentangling himself, miraculously, from between the legs of horses,
that he had not enjoyed sufficient leisure to observe the scene before
him, until it assumed the appearance we have just described."
146,"Three or four lumbering wagons,
each with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy, about the height of
the second-floor window of an ordinary house, were stowed away beneath a
lofty roof which extended over one end of the yard; and another, which
was probably to commence its journey that morning, was drawn out into
the open space."
147,"“I should like to know how—how my mother and Miss Maylie are,” said the
young man; “and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you
take, and what you talk about, and whether she—they, I mean—seem happy
and quite well."
148,"‘If you please, sir,’ I faltered, ‘if I might be allowed (I am very
sorry indeed, sir, for what I did) to take this writing off, before the
boys come back--’
Whether Mr. Creakle was in earnest, or whether he only did it to
frighten me, I don’t know, but he made a burst out of his chair, before
which I precipitately retreated, without waiting for the escort of the
man with the wooden leg, and never once stopped until I reached my own
bedroom, where, finding I was not pursued, I went to bed, as it was
time, and lay quaking, for a couple of hours."
149,"“Then he goes by some other amongst us,” rejoined the girl, “which I
more than thought before."
150,"Mr. Weller paused with an aspect
of intense disgust, and looking round, added in a whisper, 'They wos all
widders, Sammy, all on 'em, 'cept the camomile-tea vun, as wos a single
young lady o' fifty-three.'"
151,"said Mr. Pickwick.
'Speak out, Sam.'
'Why, the fact is,' said Sam, with a desperate effort, 'perhaps I'd
better see arter my bed afore I do anythin' else.'"
152,"'I do,' said Mr. Pickwick, growing energetic, as was his wont in
speaking of a subject which interested him--'I do, indeed; and to tell
you the truth, Mrs. Bardell, I have made up my mind.'"
153,"Being given to low company, she was very much in the
habit of talking to them on the beach, Miss Dartle, and sitting by their
boats."
154,"'Wery nice things, if they're managed properly, Sir,' replied Mr.
Weller; 'but wen you don't want to be seen, I think they're more useful
arter the candle's gone out, than wen it's alight.'"
155,"“Is all paid,
Becky?”
“Yes, the other gentleman’s paid,” replied the girl."
156,"Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the
tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep."
157,"Mr. Pickwick sat opposite the tipstaff; and the tipstaff sat with his
hat between his knees, whistling a tune, and looking out of the coach
window."
158,"If he had
the least idea how I adored his mistress, well he might!"
159,"'I heard something whistle through the air now--so
sharp; close to my ear.'"
160,"'When the fever left him, and consciousness returned, he awoke to find
himself rich and free, to hear that the parent who would have let him
die in jail--_would_!"
161,"You have studied Annie’s character, and you understand
it.
That’s what I find so charming!’
Even the calm and patient face of Doctor Strong expressed some little
sense of pain, I thought, under the infliction of these compliments."
162,"‘And oh, kind Heaven!’ she said, folding her thin hands
together, ‘whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in
this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child,
abandoned to its mercy!’”
“The boy’s name?” demanded the matron."
163,"Here, in the twinkling
of an eye, he divested himself of his coat, put on a threadbare garment,
which he took out of a desk, hung up his hat, pulled forth a few sheets
of cartridge and blotting-paper in alternate layers, and, sticking a pen
behind his ear, rubbed his hands with an air of great satisfaction."
164,"Good, good.
'To my shame, I must say that I am perfectly serious,' rejoined Mr.
Pickwick."
165,"At length she said,
“You’re going by coach, sir?"
166,"The stout man was smoking with
great vehemence, but between every half-dozen puffs, he took his pipe
from his mouth, and looked first at Mr. Weller and then at Mr. Pickwick."
167,"A moment afterwards we are again
eyeing him.
An unhappy culprit, found guilty of imperfect exercise,
approaches at his command."
168,"It was accordingly settled that Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr.
Snodgrass, should all wear fancy-dresses."
169,"'She knows wot's wot, she does.
I see.'
Mr. Weller closed one eye, and shook his head from side to side,
in a manner which was highly gratifying to the personal vanity of the
gentleman in blue."
170,"'Who's he?'
'The chapel,' replied Mr. Stiggins; 'our chapel; our fold, Mr."
171,"""Here, Wicks,"" says Fogg, ""take a cab, and go down to the Temple
as quick as you can, and file that."
172,"The brandy was brought; and Mr. Weller, after
pulling his hair to Mr. Pickwick, and nodding to Sam, jerked it down his
capacious throat as if it had been a small thimbleful."
173,"'Such,' thought Mr. Pickwick, 'are the narrow views of
those philosophers who, content with examining the things that lie
before them, look not to the truths which are hidden beyond."
174,"OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON.
HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF
YOUNG GENTLEMAN
Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more
gained the high-road."
175,"you seem to have been very systematic in your
proceedings.
And is your brother acquainted with all this, my dear?'"
176,"That it won’t do.
No price could make it do.
No!’--I thought
Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away, she was so emphatic
with it."
177,"Next mornin' he gets up, has a fire lit,
orders in three shillins' wurth o' crumpets, toasts 'em all, eats 'em
all, and blows his brains out.'"
178,"I always loved that boy as if he’d been my—my—my own
grandfather,” said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison."
179,"‘My grand-nephew, that is to say,’ observed my aunt.
‘Wasn’t aware you had a grand-nephew, I give you my word,’ said Mr.
Wickfield."
180,"'It must have been the cook,' said Mary.
'O' course it must,' said Sam."
181,"'There is no date to that, is there?'
inquired a juror."
182,"A casual observer, adds the secretary, to whose notes we are indebted
for the following account--a casual observer might possibly have
remarked nothing extraordinary in the bald head, and circular
spectacles, which were intently turned towards his (the secretary's)
face, during the reading of the above resolutions: to those who knew
that the gigantic brain of Pickwick was working beneath that forehead,
and that the beaming eyes of Pickwick were twinkling behind those
glasses, the sight was indeed an interesting one."
183,"'I do, indeed,' replied Doctor Slammer.
'You are bound to kick him on the spot,' murmured the owner of the camp-
stool, with great importance."
184,"The whole population of Rochester and the adjoining towns rose from
their beds at an early hour of the following morning, in a state of the
utmost bustle and excitement."
185,"And then it
will go in, you know--and then--’ said Mr. Dick, after checking himself,
and pausing a long time, ‘there’ll be a pretty kettle of fish!’
In pursuance of my aunt’s kind scheme, I was shortly afterwards fitted
out with a handsome purse of money, and a portmanteau, and tenderly
dismissed upon my expedition."
186,"The throng was increasing every moment; and the efforts they were
compelled to make, to retain the position they had gained, sufficiently
occupied their attention during the two hours that ensued."
187,"I had never, at
that time, seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was."
188,"Mr. Weller took a chair, and Sam took a box, and the umpires took what
they could get, and looked at the almanac and one or two papers which
were wafered against the wall, with as much open-eyed reverence as if
they had been the finest efforts of the old masters."
189,"‘--was induced and persuaded by me,’ I went on, swallowing that colder
designation, ‘to consent to this concealment, and I bitterly regret it.’
‘You are very much to blame, sir,’ said Mr. Spenlow, walking to and fro
upon the hearth-rug, and emphasizing what he said with his whole body
instead of his head, on account of the stiffness of his cravat and
spine."
190,"If Mr.
Copperfield, or if you, Mr. Traddles, feel the least scruple, in giving
this promise, I beg you to take time to consider it.’
I exclaimed, in a state of high ecstatic fervour, that not a moment’s
consideration could be necessary."
191,"Leaning on your arm.”
“But not the less my niece,” cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting
girl in her arms; “not the less my dearest child."
192,"Meaning nothing but a certain matured frivolity and
selfishness, not always inseparable from full-blown years, I think she
confirmed him in his fear that he was a constraint upon his young
wife, and that there was no congeniality of feeling between them, by so
strongly commending his design of lightening the load of her life."
193,"Even this,’ showing me the basket-trifle, full of keys, still
hanging at her side, ‘seems to jingle a kind of old tune!’
She smiled again, and went out at the door by which she had come."
194,"What have
paupers to do with soul or spirit?
It’s quite enough that we let ’em
have live bodies."
195,"‘A new boy, young gentlemen,’ said the Doctor; ‘Trotwood Copperfield.’
One Adams, who was the head-boy, then stepped out of his place and
welcomed me."
196,"They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might,
perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the
rain, and sheltering them from observation."
197,"It is a little document to do so much; and Traddles contemplates it,
as it lies upon my desk, half in admiration, half in awe."
198,"BLOTTON had no hesitation in saying that he had not--he had used
the word in its Pickwickian sense."
199,"The attachment and fervour of his
followers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him."
200,"'The Vellingtons has gone to Doctors' Commons.'
'No,' said the little man."
201,"But we grow
affecting: let us proceed.
In plain commonplace matter-of-fact, then, it was a fine morning--so
fine that you would scarcely have believed that the few months of an
English summer had yet flown by."
202,"If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed
behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my
task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many
struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the
strict line of duty.”
“This is unkind, mother,” said Harry."
203,"“Well, well!” said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful
tone, “I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing
that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful,
perhaps, not to wound me again."
204,"'No, no,' rejoined Bob, 'I'm a kind of plaid at present; a compound of
all sorts of colours.'"
205,"The lady started.
'Surely you did not hear them!'
she said bashfully."
206,"A dream of their coming in with Dora; of the pew-opener arranging us,
like a drill-sergeant, before the altar rails; of my wondering, even
then, why pew-openers must always be the most disagreeable females
procurable, and whether there is any religious dread of a disastrous
infection of good-humour which renders it indispensable to set those
vessels of vinegar upon the road to Heaven."
207,"He was
delighted to see me, and gave me welcome, with great heartiness, to
his little room."
208,"At last he thought
of the closet, and walked up to it.
It was of no use a little man like
Nathaniel Pipkin pulling the door inwards, when a great strong fellow
like old Lobbs was pulling it outwards."
209,"With these words Mr. Weller left the room, and immediately afterwards
was heard to shut the street door."
210,"I think I can see him now, a-coming up the
Strand between the two street-keepers, a little sobered by the bruising,
with a patch o' winegar and brown paper over his right eyelid, and that
'ere lovely bulldog, as pinned the little boy arterwards, a-following at
his heels."
211,"‘Thank you!’ He took out his pocket-handkerchief, and began wiping the
palms of his hands."
212,"But if you, being so full of learning,
Mas’r Davy, could think of anything to say as might bring her to believe
I wasn’t greatly hurt: still loving of her, and mourning for her:
anything as might bring her to believe as I was not tired of my life,
and yet was hoping fur to see her without blame, wheer the wicked cease
from troubling and the weary are at rest--anything as would ease her
sorrowful mind, and yet not make her think as I could ever marry, or as
‘twas possible that anyone could ever be to me what she was--I should
ask of you to say that--with my prayers for her--that was so dear.’
I pressed his manly hand again, and told him I would charge myself to do
this as well as I could."
213,"‘Don’t
you know?
She’s going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper."
214,"and in five mile
round--are mad against that girl.’
‘Then she should have kept to her own station in life, father,’ said
Minnie, ‘and not have given them any hold to talk about her, and then
they couldn’t have done it.’
‘Couldn’t have done it, my dear!’ retorted Mr. Omer."
215,"“Hush!” said Barney: “stradegers id the next roob.”
“Strangers!” repeated the old man in a whisper."
216,"It might have been Mr. Pickwick's appearance, or it might have been his
manner, or it might have been the temptation--irresistible to a female
mind--of hearing something at present enveloped in mystery, that reduced
the more reasonable portion of the establishment (some four individuals)
to a state of comparative quiet."
217,"“Corn’s up a little.
I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields
way, but I don’t reckon much upon it.”
“Oh, that’s quite true,” said a gentleman inside, who was looking out
of the window."
218,"'Bless us!'
said the lady.
'Are we at Freeman's Court?'"
219,"I can remember nothing that I know, without remembering him.
He
stored my mind with its first treasures, and stamped his character upon
them all."
220,"The patience and hope with which he bore these
perpetual disappointments, the mild perception he had that there was
something wrong about King Charles the First, the feeble efforts he made
to keep him out, and the certainty with which he came in, and tumbled
the Memorial out of all shape, made a deep impression on me."
221,"The very smile was taken as evidence to the contrary;
and from that time forth his reputation was established."
222,"There was an abstraction in
his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant
stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle’s mind, too great for
utterance."
223,"'The wery thing,' said Mr. Weller, who was a party interested, inasmuch
as he ardently longed to see the sport."
224,"It’s my misfortun’.’
I really couldn’t help thinking, as I sat taking in all this, that the
misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides Mrs.
Gummidge."
225,"'Chances be d----d,' replied Price; 'he hasn't half the ghost of one."
226,"'Next day is the first of September, and you're pledged to ride out with
us, as far as Sir Geoffrey Manning's grounds at all events, and to meet
us at lunch, if you don't take the field.'"
227,"“He hasn’t as good a one as himself anywhere.”
“Except sometimes,” replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of
the world."
228,"When
the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets
again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn’t deserve
anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust
behind."
229,"It appears to me highly important that Mr. Micawber
should, from the hour of his embarkation, feel his position."
230,"Mr. Tupman rang the bell, purchased the tickets, and ordered chamber
candlesticks."
231,"Those widely staring eyes, so
lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than
think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in
themselves, but giving light to nothing."
232,"These were instances of friendship for which any man might reasonably
feel most grateful."
233,"'But enough of this, gentlemen,' said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, 'it is
difficult to smile with an aching heart; it is ill jesting when our
deepest sympathies are awakened."
234,"Cheered by this prospect, the precocious boy applied
himself to his infantile treadmill, with increased vigour."
235,"I have no doubt that, girl-
like, to enhance her own value and increase the ardour of Mr. Snodgrass,
she has represented this matter in very glowing colours, and that they
have both arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly-persecuted
pair of unfortunates, and have no resource but clandestine matrimony, or
charcoal."
236,"‘Why, that’s the Wrong hand, Davy!’ laughed the gentleman."
237,"Perhaps it would be better only to
consider whether it is right to do this; and, if it is, to do it.’
I had no longer any doubt on the subject."
238,"During the last few minutes, Mrs. Heep had been clamouring to her son
to be ‘umble’; and had been going down on her knees to all of us in
succession, and making the wildest promises."
239,"And now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed
bedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the
ragged old rooks’-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom
of the front garden."
240,"Come with me.
Quick!”
Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of
such intense excitement that it infected him."
241,"She stopped
a moment before going out, as if she would have uttered something or
turned back; but no word passed her lips."
242,"'That's a dear,' said Mary.
'Now it's time I went upstairs, and got my
lady ready for dinner.'"
243,"We must make the best of it;
and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours."
244,"Her mild but earnest eyes met
mine with their own beautiful frankness, and there was no change in her
gentle face."
245,"'You are, sir, I perceive, a man of sense and talent,' said Mr. Pott,
almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration."
246,"If
you've come down for a country life, come to me, and I'll give you
plenty of it."
247,"All my old doubts and apprehensions on
that subject, all the Doctor’s happiness and peace, all the mingled
possibilities of innocence and compromise, that I could not unravel, I
saw, in a moment, at the mercy of this fellow’s twisting."
248,"The Doctor was engaged with
someone in his study; but the visitor would be gone directly, Mrs.
Strong said, and begged us to remain and see him."
249,"At first Miss Mills thought it was a quarrel, and that we were verging
on the Desert of Sahara; but she soon found out how matters stood, for
my dear affectionate little Dora, embracing her, began exclaiming that I
was ‘a poor labourer’; and then cried for me, and embraced me, and asked
me would I let her give me all her money to keep, and then fell on Miss
Mills’s neck, sobbing as if her tender heart were broken."
250,"“_There_,” replied the woman.
And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she
hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for
a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling
hands."
251,"'You'll tell him,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'that I am highly excited, highly
displeased, and naturally indignant, at the very extraordinary course he
has thought proper to pursue.'"
252,"With
this conclusion, Wardle slapped Mr. Tupman on the back, and laughed
heartily."
253,"I
warned you before we came, my dear sir, that there was nothing to look
to but a compromise.'"
254,"There was a still greater
obstacle in Oliver’s youth and childishness.
He only cried bitterly all
day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands
before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner,
tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and
drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its
cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which
surrounded him."
255,"One of the poor relations
proposed Mr. Tupman, and the other poor relation proposed Mr. Winkle;
all was happiness and festivity, until the mysterious disappearance of
both the poor relations beneath the table, warned the party that it was
time to adjourn."
256,"He comes of a bad family.
Excitable natures, Mrs.
Sowerberry!
Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his
made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed
any well-disposed woman, weeks before.”
At this point of Mr. Bumble’s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to
know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced
kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible."
257,"It’s
time you were on the lay.
It’s near ten, and nothing done yet.”
In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their
hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging,
as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in
whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very
conspicuous or peculiar: inasmuch as there are a great number of
spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr.
Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine
gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their
reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit."
258,"Never mind,' said Sam, brightening up, 'it's easily done to-
morrow, anyvays.'"
259,"The major part of the conversation was confined to Mrs. Weller and the
reverend Mr. Stiggins; and the topics principally descanted on, were the
virtues of the shepherd, the worthiness of his flock, and the high
crimes and misdemeanours of everybody beside--dissertations which the
elder Mr. Weller occasionally interrupted by half-suppressed references
to a gentleman of the name of Walker, and other running commentaries of
the same kind."
260,"Giving him private directions to seek the society of Mrs. Crupp, and
to remove the ‘young gal’ to the basement also, I abandoned myself to
enjoyment."
261,"At last I ran away myself, whenever I saw an emissary of the police
approaching with some new intelligence; and lived a stealthy life until
he was tried and ordered to be transported."
262,"'Are you a cricketer?'
inquired Mr. Wardle of the marksman.
At any other time, Mr. Winkle would have replied in the affirmative."
263,"“He’ll come
to be scragged, won’t he?”
“I don’t know what that means,” replied Oliver."
264,"'Serious, from my heart--from my soul!'
returned Mr. Winkle, with great
energy."
265,"As Mr. Pickwick was further prompted to betake himself to Gray's Inn
Square by an anxious desire to come to a pecuniary settlement with the
kind-hearted little attorney without further delay, he made a hurried
breakfast, and executed his intention so speedily, that ten o'clock had
not struck when he reached Gray's Inn."
266,"When we clattered through the narrow street of Chatham, and I
caught a glimpse, in passing, of the lane where the old monster lived
who had bought my jacket, I stretched my neck eagerly to look for the
place where I had sat, in the sun and in the shade, waiting for my
money."
267,"And Mr. Nupkins was sitting in his easy-chair,
frowning with majesty, and boiling with rage, when a lady was announced
on pressing, private, and particular business."
268,"'I will even go further than this, Mr. Winkle,' continued Mr. Phunky, in
a most smooth and complacent manner."
269,"What an evening, when Mrs. Crupp, coming in to take away the
broth-basin, produced one kidney on a cheese-plate as the entire remains
of yesterday’s feast, and I was really inclined to fall upon her nankeen
breast and say, in heartfelt penitence, ‘Oh, Mrs. Crupp, Mrs. Crupp,
never mind the broken meats!"
270,"I am sure you won’t be, when you
learn that Agnes is not unhappy in any attachment.’
‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said my aunt."
271,"‘Oh what a shocking
boy!’
‘But I shall never try any more,’ said I."
272,"“And have done none,” said the stranger.
Another silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken
by the stranger."
273,"'He attempted
to rescue the prisoners, and assaulted the officers; so we took him into
custody, and brought him here.'"
274,"The ceiling was blackened, to prevent
its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the
place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely
possible to discern anything more."
275,"'Which other?'
'Why, that servant, or friend, or whatever he is; you know, Trotter.'"
276,"“Save us!” said the old lady, with tears in her eyes."
277,"This may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go
farther back into such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe
the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite
wonderful for its closeness and accuracy."
278,"The slightest provocation, even being asked if there is
anything he would prefer for dinner, causes him to express a wish for a
separation."
279,"Gentlemen, our friend Mr. Whiffers (everybody
looked at the individual in orange), our friend Mr. Whiffers has
resigned.'"
280,"It appeared to me that he was
more clever and cold than they were, and that they regarded him with
something of my own feeling."
281,"Turning these things in his mind, as he mounted the narrow staircase at
the foot of which Roker had left him, Mr. Pickwick gradually worked
himself to the boiling-over point; and so excited was he with his
reflections on this subject, that he had burst into the room to which he
had been directed, before he had any distinct recollection, either of
the place in which he was, or of the object of his visit."
282,"'I could tell you a story about that same uncle, gentlemen, that
would rather surprise you.'"
283,"'""He's a tall man,"" said Tom.
'""He is a very fine man, Sir,"" replied the widow, ""and a very nice
gentleman."""
284,"Come!’
‘Yes, John,’ returned the Soldier.
‘Virtually, an old married woman."
285,"I'll follow him.'
'You're quite certain it was them, governor?'"
286,"TOO FULL OF ADVENTURE TO BE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED
There is no month in the whole year in which nature wears a more
beautiful appearance than in the month of August."
287,"I
would give them D.!’ which so excited and gratified Mr. Micawber,
that he ran with a glass of punch into my bedroom, in order that Mrs.
Micawber might drink D., who drank it with enthusiasm, crying from
within, in a shrill voice, ‘Hear, hear!"
288,"'Stay; no.
The poor side, you
say?
I should like to see it."
289,"“Here is another letter,” said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; “but
whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I
scarcely know."
290,"Here is Mr.
Micawber with a variety of qualifications--with great talent--’
‘Really, my love,’ said Mr. Micawber."
291,"“You have a cat, ma’am, I see,” said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who,
in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; “and kittens
too, I declare!”
“I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can’t think,” replied the
matron."
292,"you were at it by candle-light last night, when I was at the
club, then?"
293,"As all this was said with much gravity, and as
Nathaniel Pipkin walked home with Maria Lobbs, and struggled for a kiss
at parting, he went to bed a happy man, and dreamed all night long, of
softening old Lobbs, opening the strong box, and marrying Maria."
294,"Accordingly, the special was abused, vehemently, for a
quarter of an hour, and sent about his business; and Grummer, Dubbley,
Muzzle, and all the other specials, murmured their admiration of the
magnanimity of Mr. Nupkins."
295,"So powerful were these visionary considerations in my boyish mind, that
I seem, according to my present way of thinking, to have left school
without natural regret."
296,"And now come here, and I’ll show you how to take the marks
out of the handkerchiefs.”
Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman’s pocket in play, had to
do with his chances of being a great man."
297,"Even when she was quite a child,
she was the Agnes whom we know,’ said I."
298,"They were both very gay and lively fellows; Grainger, something older
than Steerforth; Markham, youthful-looking, and I should say not
more than twenty."
299,"'So we had,' said Mr. Pickwick; 'very true; I can write to Bury, and
tell them to meet me at Ipswich."
300,"'Well,' said that gentleman, 'if you leave me to suggest our
destination, I say Bath."
301,"A tall man--a
confoundedly tall man--with black whiskers.""
'""Tom,"" said the old gentleman; ""she will never have him."""
302,"and how happily too; like all the
other days in that most happy time!"
303,"In another hour it had much increased, and
the sky was more overcast, and blew hard."
304,"“The
room-door is open, is it?”
“Wide,” replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself."
305,"I remember that I thought it, in form, more like
a riding-habit with the superfluous skirt cut off, than anything else."
306,"Mr. Pickwick, with his usual foresight and sagacity, had chosen a
peculiarly desirable moment for his visit to the borough."
307,"with an astonishing volume of voice; and then sat
down, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn."
308,"“I sold myself,” said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection,
“for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small
quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money."
309,"‘You have been a long time,’ she said, ‘without coming here."
310,"“The place should be somewhere here,” said Bumble, consulting a scrap
of paper he held in his hand."
311,"I wish mother
had come here.
It would be better for everybody, if they got took up,
and was brought here.’
This sentiment gave unbounded satisfaction--greater satisfaction, I
think, than anything that had passed yet."
312,"I don’t think your friend’s
there.”
“Sikes is not, I suppose?” inquired the Jew, with a disappointed
countenance."
313,"The ravages committed by this
unfortunate, rendering her dismissal necessary, she was succeeded (with
intervals of Mrs. Kidgerbury) by a long line of Incapables; terminating
in a young person of genteel appearance, who went to Greenwich Fair in
Dora’s bonnet."
314,"'I surprise you, I see, ma'am,' said the old gentleman."
315,"On the
first, he endeavoured to amuse his master by anecdote and conversation;
on the second, Mr. Pickwick demanded his writing-desk, and pen and ink,
and was deeply engaged during the whole day."
316,‘Is it the last occupant’s furniture?’ inquired my aunt.
317,"‘By your look.’
He seemed very much amused, and laughed as heartily as it was in his
nature to laugh."
318,"‘Why
should you be so uncomfortable?’
‘Thank you, Trot,’ replied my aunt, ‘I prefer to sit upon my property.’
Here my aunt looked hard at Mrs. Crupp, and observed, ‘We needn’t
trouble you to wait, ma’am.’
‘Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma’am?’ said Mrs.
Crupp."
319,"The topic is fraught with such danger to the bonnet, that Miss Lavinia
gives another little scream, and begs me to understand that Dora is only
to be looked at, and on no account to be touched."
320,"She was truly fond of me, and proud of me; and when Agnes
wrote a few earnest words in her letters to Dora, of the pride and
interest with which my old friends heard of my growing reputation, and
read my book as if they heard me speaking its contents, Dora read them
out to me with tears of joy in her bright eyes, and said I was a dear
old clever, famous boy."
321,"“That’s for your people,” said the guard.
“Now, look alive in there,
will you."
322,"In short, I was not a favourite with Miss Murdstone.
In short, I was not
a favourite there with anybody, not even with myself; for those who did
like me could not show it, and those who did not, showed it so plainly
that I had a sensitive consciousness of always appearing constrained,
boorish, and dull."
323,"'Wery careful that he don't say nothin' to her,' responded Mr. Weller."
324,"Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter
cold."
325,"'I will see the
lady who keeps the establishment immediately.'
'I beg your pardon, Sir,' said Job, 'but that course of proceeding will
never do.'"
326,"You mustn’t do
it!’
This argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her
increasing indisposition had a larger one."
327,"If a man wished to abstract himself from
the world--to remove himself from within the reach of temptation--to
place himself beyond the possibility of any inducement to look out of
the window--we should recommend him by all means go to Lant Street."
328,"Allow me to
have the felicity of hanging up your nightcap, Sir.'"
329,"Mr. Sawyer, being a bachelor, had only one
tumbler in the house, which was assigned to Mr. Winkle as a compliment
to the visitor, Mr. Ben Allen being accommodated with a funnel with a
cork in the narrow end, and Bob Sawyer contented himself with one of
those wide-lipped crystal vessels inscribed with a variety of cabalistic
characters, in which chemists are wont to measure out their liquid drugs
in compounding prescriptions."
330,"'How awkward you are,' said the pretty housemaid.
'You'll lose it again,
if you don't take care.'"
331,"The tall man
was standing in the snug little bar, with his hands behind him, quite at
home."
332,"She had loitered for a few paces
as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound
determined her, and she stepped into the hall."
333,"'My what, did you say?'
'Your chummage ticket,' replied Mr. Roker; 'you're up to that?'"
334,"As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon
him, it rolled down his cheek.
It was followed by another, and another."
335,"He
stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and
looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute
astonishment."
336,"'Many eyes, that have long since been closed in the grave, have looked
round upon that scene lightly enough, when entering the gate of the old
Marshalsea Prison for the first time; for despair seldom comes with the
first severe shock of misfortune."
337,"Sauntering or sitting about, in
every possible attitude of listless idleness, were a great number of
debtors, the major part of whom were waiting in prison until their day
of 'going up' before the Insolvent Court should arrive; while others had
been remanded for various terms, which they were idling away as they
best could."
338,"‘Well, ma’am,’ returned Mr. Chillip, ‘we are--we are progressing slowly,
ma’am.’
‘Ya--a--ah!’ said my aunt."
339,"‘His housekeeper must be in his house, you know.’
‘He is very fond of you, I am sure,’ I said."
340,"I
needed no second permission; though I was by this time in such a state
of consternation and agitation, that my legs shook under me."
341,"You are no
stranger to the fact, that there have been periods of my life, when it
has been requisite that I should pause, until certain expected events
should turn up; when it has been necessary that I should fall back,
before making what I trust I shall not be accused of presumption in
terming--a spring."
342,"At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking
round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of
water."
343,"I provided, and sent down by the Norwood coach the night before, a
delicate little hamper, amounting in itself, I thought, almost to a
declaration."
344,"Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed
oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she."
345,"'Don't hang
back, or look sentimental about it; it can't be helped, old fellow."
346,"There is only
one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the
Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish."
347,"'How very odd!'
said Mr. Pickwick.
odd indeed,' returned the old gentleman; 'I'm proud of that boy--
wouldn't part with him on any account--he's a natural curiosity!"
348,"Peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee, which would have
lasted us out handsomely, if we had been going to London by the same
conveyance."
349,"Excuse us for one instant, gentlemen.'
Hurrying on in this way, Mr.
Peter Magnus drew Mr. Pickwick from the room."
350,"I could have wished he had been less obliged to me, for
he hovered about me in his gratitude all the rest of the evening; and
whenever I said a word to Agnes, was sure, with his shadowless eyes and
cadaverous face, to be looking gauntly down upon us from behind."
351,"But he said to me
aside in a meek voice:
‘I am well aware, Master Copperfield, that Miss Trotwood, though an
excellent lady, has a quick temper (indeed I think I had the pleasure
of knowing her, when I was a numble clerk, before you did, Master
Copperfield), and it’s only natural, I am sure, that it should be made
quicker by present circumstances."
352,"My uncle did so, and I honour
him for it.
'""Hark!"""
353,"These sequestered nooks are the public offices of the legal profession,
where writs are issued, judgments signed, declarations filed, and
numerous other ingenious machines put in motion for the torture and
torment of His Majesty's liege subjects, and the comfort and emolument
of the practitioners of the law."
354,"‘It’s quite dry.’
‘So ‘tis!’ said Mr. Peggotty, feeling my shoulders."
355,"I felt,
all this while, as if my ear were blazing; he pinched it so hard."
356,"I have remembered Who
wept for a parting between the living and the dead."
357,"He drew back the bolts with a
trembling hand, and opened the door."
358,"Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed,
he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy
habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by
sending them supperless to bed."
359,"Most people know.
I say nothing.
Observations have already
been made, in this room, injurious to the reputation of my noble friend."
360,"‘The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs. Micawber and
myself, is now withdrawn,’ said Mr. Micawber; ‘and my children and the
Author of their Being can once more come in contact on equal terms.’
As we were all very grateful to him, and all desirous to show that we
were, as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit, I
dare say we should all have gone, but that it was necessary for Agnes to
return to her father, as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of
hope; and for someone else to hold Uriah in safe keeping."
361,"‘I gave your message, Mr. Barkis,’ I said: ‘I wrote to Peggotty.’
‘Ah!’ said Mr. Barkis."
362,"She was the
cause of our first little quarrel.
‘My dearest life,’ I said one day to Dora, ‘do you think Mary Anne has
any idea of time?’
‘Why, Doady?’ inquired Dora, looking up, innocently, from her drawing."
363,"'Why, here they are.'
'No, no; I mean the others,' said the bewildered Winkle."
364,"'Certainly' said Mr. Pickwick; and down they sat.
There was a gigantic round of cold beef on the table, and Mr. Pickwick
was supplied with a plentiful portion of it."
365,"I
deferred to his opinion, though I had great doubts of it myself."
366,"It is impossible to conceive the disgust which this avowal awakened in
the bosoms of the hearers."
367,"'I wondered at what house the Bath
coach put up.
Perhaps you can inform me.'"
368,"I’ve been lamed
with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I’ll
be content to eat my own head, sir!”
This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed
nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his
case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility
of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable
a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed,
Mr. Grimwig’s head was such a particularly large one, that the most
sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get
through it at a sitting—to put entirely out of the question, a very
thick coating of powder."
369,"'Lots of money--old girl--pompous doctor--not a bad idea--good fun,'
were the intelligible sentences which issued from his lips."
370,"I’ll try to be
plainer, another time.---Is that Mr. Maldon a-norseback, ringing at the
gate, sir?’
‘It looks like him,’ I replied, as carelessly as I could."
371,"At the appointed time in the evening, Mr. Micawber reappeared.
I washed
my hands and face, to do the greater honour to his gentility, and we
walked to our house, as I suppose I must now call it, together; Mr.
Micawber impressing the name of streets, and the shapes of corner houses
upon me, as we went along, that I might find my way back, easily, in the
morning."
372,"In this coffer, his riches hid themselves with such a
tenacious modesty, that the smallest instalments could only be tempted
out by artifice; so that Peggotty had to prepare a long and elaborate
scheme, a very Gunpowder Plot, for every Saturday’s expenses."
373,"‘To think that I could be offended!’
‘No, no, I didn’t really think so,’ returned Dora; ‘but I am a little
tired, and it made me silly for a moment--I am always a silly little
thing, you know, but it made me more silly--to talk about Jip."
374,"I’m your man.”
“I knew you would be,” cried Fagin, elated by the success of his
proposal."
375,"said the person who had addressed my
uncle before.
He was dressed as a mail guard, with a wig on his head and
most enormous cuffs to his coat, and had a lantern in one hand, and a
huge blunderbuss in the other, which he was going to stow away in his
little arm-chest."
376,"Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah
did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry
was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and
a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as
comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in
the grain department of a brewery."
377,"Mr. Luffey, the highest ornament of Dingley Dell, was pitched
to bowl against the redoubtable Dumkins, and Mr."
378,"‘Em’ly,’ said he, ‘arter you left her, ma’am--and I never heerd her
saying of her prayers at night, t’other side the canvas screen, when we
was settled in the Bush, but what I heerd your name--and arter she and
me lost sight of Mas’r Davy, that theer shining sundown--was that low,
at first, that, if she had know’d then what Mas’r Davy kep from us so
kind and thowtful, ‘tis my opinion she’d have drooped away."
379,"There was a perpetual slamming
and banging of doors as the people went in and out; and the noise of
their voices and footsteps echoed and re-echoed through the passages
constantly."
380,"‘Well, I think I should.
I must see what
can be done."
381,"'It is a very long time since I drank the waters, certainly,' replied
Mr. Pickwick; 'for, to the best of my knowledge, I was never here
before.'"
382,"said his
right hand neighbour, a gentleman in a checked shirt and Mosaic studs,
with a cigar in his mouth."
383,"So my mother suspected,
at least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire: too
much scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and
bewildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what
to say."
384,"“Why, sure you’re not afraid of it?” said the old lady: observing in
great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the
painting."
385,"I sit down by the fire, thinking with a blind remorse of all those
secret feelings I have nourished since my marriage."
386,"Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old
lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable
delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most
violently."
387,"; Bantam; Mr. Pickwick.
Know each other.'
'Welcome to Ba--ath, Sir."
388,"‘Sir,’ said Mrs. Crupp, in a tone approaching to severity, ‘I’ve
laundressed other young gentlemen besides yourself."
389,"Bumble, I shall
scream!” Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner,
put his arm round the matron’s waist."
390,"'It's only a kind o'
quiet laugh as I'm a-tryin' to come, Sammy.'"
391,"My disposition is, if I
may say so, eminently practical.
I know that this is a long voyage."
392,"There was a knocker upon the door, but it was not
that which made the sound."
393,"I kissed her, and my baby brother, and was very sorry then; but not
sorry to go away, for the gulf between us was there, and the parting was
there, every day."
394,"'The people are coming down the crescent now.
There are ladies with 'em;
cover me up with something."
395,"A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself.
Looking round,
he saw that the jurymen had turned together, to consider their verdict."
396,"exclaimed the spinster aunt; and strong symptoms of
fit number three developed themselves forthwith."
397,"They drew their chairs closer
together, starting at every sound.
They spoke little, and that in
whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the
murdered woman lay in the next room."
398,"She put her hand upon it hurriedly--a
hand so thin and delicate, that when I had seen her hold it up before
the fire to shade her face, I had compared it in my thoughts to fine
porcelain--and saying, in a quick, fierce, passionate way, ‘I swear you
to secrecy about this!’ said not a word more."
399,"the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window."
400,"I
never did see such prime company as that ’ere boy; he’ll be the death
of me, I know he will.” Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily
again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes."
401,"'I've no objection to take you that way.
Say, makes away with
himself.'"
402,"She had been walking in the
churchyard, too, very early; and she got into the cart, and sat in it
with her handkerchief at her eyes."
403,"'Have you got your vind back agin, Sir,' inquired Sam, when they had
reached the end."
404,"‘Mas’r Davy,’ Ham whispered, drawing me aside, while Mr. Peggotty was
stowing his bag among the luggage, ‘his life is quite broke up."
405,"‘A deceitful, bad-hearted girl,’ said Mrs. Joram.
‘There was no good in
her, ever!’
‘Don’t say so,’ I returned."
406,"But there’ll be someone else, soon,--someone else, soon, Em’ly!’
Afterwards, when I went upstairs, as I passed the door of my little
chamber, which was dark, I had an indistinct impression of her being
within it, cast down upon the floor."
407,"The trampers were worse than ever that day, and inspired me with a
dread that is yet quite fresh in my mind."
408,"“I should like,” he said, “to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig."
409,"Having loitered
here, for half an hour or so, Mr. Weller turned, and began wending his
way towards Leadenhall Market, through a variety of by-streets and
courts."
410,"“No,” said the old gentleman, shaking his head; “it must be
imagination.”
He wandered over them again."
411,"Agnes is worth the
whole firm, in my opinion.’
‘If I may umbly make the remark,’ said Uriah Heep, with a writhe, ‘I
fully agree with Miss Betsey Trotwood, and should be only too appy if
Miss Agnes was a partner.’
‘You’re a partner yourself, you know,’ returned my aunt, ‘and that’s
about enough for you, I expect."
412,"'Well,' said Perker, 'don't you know that gentleman?'
'Good reason to,' replied Mr. Jingle, stepping forward."
413,"'The old man cast down his eyes at this reproof, and they met those of
his daughter."
414,"A short pause followed these consolatory remarks of Mr. Weller.
Then Mr.
Ben Allen rising from his chair, protested that he would never see
Arabella's face again; while Mr. Bob Sawyer, despite Sam's flattering
assurance, vowed dreadful vengeance on the happy bridegroom."
415,"‘When I loved Dora--fondly, Agnes, as you know--’
‘Yes!’ she cried, earnestly."
416,"But no dog appeared, and at length he
resumed his journey.
MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET."
417,"'You don't say so,' said that gentleman, at the conclusion of the
whisper."
418,"'Is anybody else a-goin', Tommy?'
said Mrs. Cluppins, arranging her
pelerine."
419,"He took up his quarters at the Bush, and designing to postpone any
communication by letter with Mr. Pickwick until it was probable that Mr.
Dowler's wrath might have in some degree evaporated, walked forth to
view the city, which struck him as being a shade more dirty than any
place he had ever seen."
420,"Nor is this, the most
striking phenomenon incidental to such a state.
It is an undoubted
fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead,
yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before
us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent
presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when
we closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking
consciousness."
421,"“There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date;
which is within a year before the child was born."
422,"'Ah, to be sure,' said Perker gravely.
'You must take this matter in
hand for them, my dear sir."
423,"When he was gone, I rang for Mrs. Crupp, and acquainted her with my
desperate design."
424,"But its
most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit
of paper, on which was written, in my mother’s hand, ‘For Davy."
425,"As to the wictim of oppression in the
suit o' brimstone, all I can say of him, is, that I hope he'll get jist
as good a berth as he deserves; in vitch case it's wery little cold
swarry as ever he'll be troubled with agin.'"
426,"'If this,' said Mr. Pickwick, looking about him--'if this were the place
to which all who are troubled with our friend's complaint came, I fancy
their old attachment to this world would very soon return.'"
427,"Our old neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Grayper, were gone to South America,
and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house,
and stained the outer walls."
428,"I am so rejoiced to see you, Trotwood!’
‘Dear Agnes, the happiness it is to me, to see you once again!’
I folded her to my heart, and, for a little while, we were both silent."
429,"'Well, gentlemen,' said the stout man, 'very glad to see you."
430,"But that one dark glimpse of the
river, through the gateway, had instinctively prepared me for her going
no farther."
431,"'Let me wrap this shawl round you, Mr.
'Ah, that's the best thing you can do,' said Wardle; 'and when you've
got it on, run home as fast as your legs can carry you, and jump into
bed directly.'"
432,"I know no more, and I can say no more.’
Again she repressed the tears that had begun to flow; and, putting out
her trembling hand, and touching Mr. Peggotty, as if there was some
healing virtue in him, went away along the desolate road."
433,"One day I was informed by Mr. Mell that Mr. Creakle would be home that
evening."
434,"Tiggin and Welps were in the printed calico and waistcoat
piece line, gentlemen, so my uncle knew all the materials at once."
435,"‘We’ll go and look at ‘em.’
Away we went."
436,"One fair evening, when Dora was not inclined to go out, my aunt and I
strolled up to the Doctor’s cottage."
437,"'Here is the entry,' resumed Dodson.
'""Middlesex, Capias MARTHA BARDELL,
WIDOW, v. SAMUEL PICKWICK."
438,"'That is--yes--oh, yes--certainly.'
'You have never known anything in his behaviour towards Mrs. Bardell, or
any other female, in the least degree suspicious?'"
439,"Pray make haste!
I feel as if I should
die: it makes me tremble so.”
“Come, come!” said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder."
440,"He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.”
“I know you well,” replied the girl, without manifesting the least
emotion."
441,"‘As we are quite confidential here, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs.
Micawber, sipping her punch, ‘Mr."
442,"A clerk hurried in with a bundle of papers, and stared about him."
443,"The fat boy had by this time finished the pie.
He fixed his eyes on
Mary, and replied--
'I knows a nicerer.'"
444,"True enough, that, Mr. Weller,' said the breathless Mr. Pickwick good-
humouredly, as he took his seat on the box beside him."
445,"Does he think to
reduce me by long absence?
He knows his mother very little if he does."
446,"‘When I explained my altered position to you, sir,’ I began again,
substituting a new form of expression for what was so unpalatable to
him, ‘this concealment, into which I am so unhappy as to have led Miss
Spenlow, had begun."
447,"Come away—out of the public road—down the steps yonder!”
As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction
in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and
roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on."
448,"'Did you hear the defendant say anything?'
'I heard him call Mrs. Bardell a good creature, and I heard him ask her
to compose herself, for what a situation it was, if anybody should come,
or words to that effect.'"
449,"Because I’m ruined, my dear!’
If the house, and every one of us, had tumbled out into the river
together, I could hardly have received a greater shock."
450,"“This is a painful task,” said he, “but these declarations, which have
been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance
repeated here."
451,"In the agonies of composition, the
elderly gentleman looked sometimes at the carpet, sometimes at the
ceiling, and sometimes at the wall; and when neither carpet, ceiling,
nor wall afforded the requisite degree of inspiration, he looked out of
the window."
452,"What she gave her, I don’t know.
I saw her stooping over her,
and putting money in her bosom."
453,"“The amiable old Proctor”--who’s
he?
Dear me, Annie, how illegibly your cousin Maldon writes, and how
stupid I am!"
454,"The right was reserved for the Buff party, and the centre for the mayor
and his officers; one of whom--the fat crier of Eatanswill--was ringing
an enormous bell, by way of commanding silence, while Mr. Horatio
Fizkin, and the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, with their hands upon their
hearts, were bowing with the utmost affability to the troubled sea of
heads that inundated the open space in front; and from whence arose a
storm of groans, and shouts, and yells, and hootings, that would have
done honour to an earthquake."
455,"Uttering shriek upon shriek, she sank upon the ground.
'Now I could have killed her without a struggle; but the house was
alarmed."
456,"Let this be a
lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet."
457,"But when I say the eldest is a Beauty, I mean she really is
a--’ he seemed to be describing clouds about himself, with both hands:
‘Splendid, you know,’ said Traddles, energetically."
458,"The door opened, and I looked, half laughing and half crying in my
pleasant agitation, for my mother."
459,"So I told papa last night I must come out.
Besides, it’s
the brightest time of the whole day."
460,"We turned back, on my humbly insinuating
that it might be useful to me hereafter; and he told the clerk that the
carrier had instructions to call for it at noon."
461,"Miss Mowcher winked assent.
‘Forced to send for me.
Couldn’t help it."
462,"Long after the subject was dismissed,
and other topics occupied us, he remained so; seldom raising his eyes,
unless to rest them for a moment, with a thoughtful frown, upon the
Doctor, or his wife, or both."
463,"'""Well,"" said Tom, slowly undressing himself, and staring at the old
chair all the while, which stood with a mysterious aspect by the
bedside, ""I never saw such a rum concern as that in my days."
464,"She knew how trial
and emotion would exalt and strengthen it.
She was sure that in my every
purpose I should gain a firmer and a higher tendency, through the grief
I had undergone."
465,"'Beg your pardon, sir,' rejoined Sam, 'but it 'ud be a wery great favour
to pay it, and he don't deserve none; that's where it is, sir.'"
466,"So the fortnight slipped away, varied by nothing but the variation of
the tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty’s times of going out and coming in,
and altered Ham’s engagements also."
467,"And how I used to
laugh for joy, when I was alone, and thought how well I kept my secret,
and how quickly my kind friends would have fallen from me, if they had
known the truth."
468,"His
breathing was hard and thick, and he moaned painfully as it came and
went."
469,"I begged him
to do me the favour of presiding; and my request being seconded by the
other boys who were in that room, he acceded to it, and sat upon my
pillow, handing round the viands--with perfect fairness, I must say--and
dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot, which was
his own property."
470,"'Nathaniel, sir--my Lord, I mean.'
'Nathaniel Daniel, or Daniel Nathaniel?'"
471,"There was a very dirty lady in his little room, and two wan
girls, his daughters, with shock heads of hair."
472,"These were all reasons for the greatest caution and
most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose
first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy
doctor on the subject."
473,"On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie
repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something
of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless."
474,"“There; take him away, I
can’t bear the sight on him.”
Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar."
475,"‘Annie!’ said the Doctor, tenderly taking her in his hands."
476,"Missing his aim, he fell into the
ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head
against a stone, dashed out his brains."
477,"‘If you’re Master Murdstone,’ said the lady, ‘why do you go and give
another name, first?’
I explained to the lady how it was, who than rang a bell, and called
out, ‘William!"
478,"I wallow in
words.
Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a
trussed fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound
hand and foot with red tape."
479,"Harry cast one slight glance at the
latticed window, and jumped into the carriage."
480,"Didn't I say so?'
Here Mrs. Nupkins sobbed.
'Oh, pa!'"
481,"'You'd ha'
made an uncommon fine oyster, Sammy, if you'd been born in that station
o' life.'"
482,"I have a better right to it than any
other man!’
I had my arms round Mr. Wickfield, imploring him by everything that I
could think of, oftenest of all by his love for Agnes, to calm himself
a little."
483,"I told her so, earnestly.
‘And when this visit is over,’ said I,--‘for we may not be alone another
time,--how long is it likely to be, my dear Agnes, before you come to
London again?’
‘Probably a long time,’ she replied; ‘I think it will be best--for
papa’s sake--to remain at home."
484,"No description I could give of her
would do justice to my recollection of her, or to her entire deliverance
of herself to her anger."
485,"‘Look at me!
My wind may fail me at any moment, and it ain’t
likely that, to my own knowledge, I’d be self-interested under such
circumstances."
486,"It was quite
a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of
jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the
place with their delicious perfume."
487,"Very odd,""
said Tom, who had got rather sage with the hot punch--""very odd."""
488,"A new Acquaintance--The
Stroller's Tale--A disagreeable Interruption, and an unpleasant
Encounter 4."
489,"“I _will_ speak,” cried the man; “I will not be turned out."
490,"Julia is steeped in
money to the throat, and talks and thinks of nothing else."
491,"The clerks were there, but nobody was doing anything.
Old Tiffey, for
the first time in his life I should think, was sitting on somebody
else’s stool, and had not hung up his hat."
492,"He looked like a young clergyman, in his white cravat, but
he was very affable and good-humoured; and he showed me my place, and
presented me to the masters, in a gentlemanly way that would have put me
at my ease, if anything could."
493,"I seem, then,
to be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins.
Everything that belongs to
her, or is connected with her, is precious to me."
494,"And the learned gentleman, with a firm
and steady frown, placed his hands on his hips, and smiled suspiciously
to the jury."
495,"'Not as I knows on,' replied the fat boy.
'I should rayther ha' thought, to look at you, that you was a-labourin'
under an unrequited attachment to some young 'ooman,' said Sam."
496,"'Oh, quite enough to get, Sir, as the soldier said ven they ordered him
three hundred and fifty lashes,' replied Sam."
497,"It was a dark, cold night, with a chill, damp wind, which blew
the rain heavily against the windows and house-fronts."
498,"However, she’s Barkis now.
That’s some comfort.
Barkis is uncommonly fond of you, Trot.’
‘There is nothing she would leave undone to prove it,’ said I."
499,"'Just as well,' replied Sam.
'Drive on, Sammy,' said Mr. Weller."
500,"how Mr. Tupman lay prostrate on the ground; and how Mr. Winkle
knelt horror-stricken beside him; how Mr. Tupman called distractedly
upon some feminine Christian name, and then opened first one eye, and
then the other, and then fell back and shut them both--all this would be
as difficult to describe in detail, as it would be to depict the gradual
recovering of the unfortunate individual, the binding up of his arm with
pocket-handkerchiefs, and the conveying him back by slow degrees
supported by the arms of his anxious friends."
501,"‘What name would it be as I should write up now, if there was a tilt
here?’
‘Clara Peggotty, again?’ I suggested."
502,"By
and by we went to church.
Miss Murdstone was between Dora and me in the
pew; but I heard her sing, and the congregation vanished."
503,"Is it lonely, down-stairs, Doady?’
‘Very!
Very!’
‘Don’t cry!"
504,"He took off his cloak, however, in silence--it always
took a long time to undo that cloak--and accepted the pistol."
505,"Before I leave
this place, Rose shall hear me.”
“She shall,” said Mrs. Maylie."
506,"After repeating this
process several times without effect, he ventured to open the door and
peep in."
507,"“I have no doubt you are, my friend,” replied the old gentleman: fixing
his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the
inkstand."
508,"'You are sure you did not, sir?'
said Mr. Winkle, senior."
509,"I never saw my aunt unbend more systematically to anyone.
She
courted Jip, though Jip never responded; listened, day after day, to the
guitar, though I am afraid she had no taste for music; never attacked
the Incapables, though the temptation must have been severe; went
wonderful distances on foot to purchase, as surprises, any trifles that
she found out Dora wanted; and never came in by the garden, and missed
her from the room, but she would call out, at the foot of the stairs, in
a voice that sounded cheerfully all over the house:
‘Where’s Little Blossom?’
CHAPTER 45."
510,"This is a conspiracy!
You have met here by appointment!
You are
playing Booty with my clerk, are you, Copperfield?"
511,"At
length her eyes were lifted up to mine, and she stood on tiptoe to
give me, more thoughtfully than usual, that precious little kiss--once,
twice, three times--and went out of the room."
512,"He solemnly conjured me,
I remember, to take warning by his fate; and to observe that if a man
had twenty pounds a-year for his income, and spent nineteen pounds
nineteen shillings and sixpence, he would be happy, but that if he
spent twenty pounds one he would be miserable."
513,"Mr. Dubbley did as he was desired; and half a dozen men, each with a
short truncheon and a brass crown, flocked into the room."
514,"“Only just up to the office, my dear,” said the Jew coaxingly."
515,"Here, four or five great hulking
fellows, just visible through a cloud of tobacco smoke, were engaged in
noisy and riotous conversation over half-emptied pots of beer, or
playing at all-fours with a very greasy pack of cards."
516,"Like a gas-lamp in the street, with the wind
in the pipe, he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy, then
sank so low as to be scarcely discernible; after a short interval, he
had burst out again, to enlighten for a moment; then flickered with an
uncertain, staggering sort of light, and then gone out altogether."
517,"A red-headed man was working in the garden; and to him Mr.
Pickwick called lustily, 'Hollo there!'"
518,"'Where is it?'
'Paul's Churchyard, Sir; low archway on the carriage side, bookseller's
at one corner, hotel on the other, and two porters in the middle as
touts for licences.'"
519,"I had been writing, in the newspaper and elsewhere, so
prosperously, that when my new success was achieved, I considered myself
reasonably entitled to escape from the dreary debates."
520,"But I told Traddles, and Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, that before I could
think of leaving, they must appoint a day when they would come and dine
with me."
521,"I repair to the enchanted house, where there are
lights, chattering, music, flowers, officers (I am sorry to see), and
the eldest Miss Larkins, a blaze of beauty."
522,"“Who’s that?” she cried, in a hollow voice."
523,"The cloth was laid by an occasional charwoman, who officiated
in the capacity of Mr. Bob Sawyer's housekeeper; and a third knife and
fork having been borrowed from the mother of the boy in the gray livery
(for Mr. Sawyer's domestic arrangements were as yet conducted on a
limited scale), they sat down to dinner; the beer being served up, as
Mr. Sawyer remarked, 'in its native pewter.'"
524,"'You might ha' made a worser guess than that, old feller,' replied Mr.
Weller the younger, setting down his burden in the yard, and sitting
himself down upon it afterwards."
525,"(Cries of ""Order,"" ""Chair,"" ""Yes,"" ""No,"" ""Go on,"" ""Leave
off,"" etc.)"
526,"'You didn't know me, but I knew
two friends of yours that were stopping at the Peacock at Eatanswill, at
the time of the election.'"
527,"Then I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters, as we
walked about on a Saturday afternoon."
528,"On seeing the master
enter, the old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee, and said
something that I thought sounded like ‘My Charley!’ but on seeing me
come in too, she got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of
half curtsey."
529,"‘Oh, it’s you, is it?’ said little Em’ly."
530,"I felt more miserable and
destitute than I had done at any period of my running away."
531,"Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made.
They were
unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back
with her to France.”
“There she died,” said Monks, “after a lingering illness; and, on her
death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her
unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved—though she
need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before."
532,"I will
not have this room shunned as if it were infected, at the pleasure of a
child."
533,"She stood beside it for some little while, in a
curious way, going through the motion of playing it with her right hand,
but not sounding it."
534,"This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the
burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse,
and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in
the pursuit."
535,"‘Tis little (considering the time) as she has said, in wureds,
through them broken-hearted tears; ‘tis less as I have seen of her dear
face, as grow’d into a woman’s at my hearth."
536,"The clouds, which had
been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of
vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a
violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the
main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered
little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half,
or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon
the river."
537,"“What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!” said Duff, addressing Mr.
Giles, with supreme contempt."
538,"'There,' said Lowten, 'it's too late now.
You can't get in to-night;
you've got the key of the street, my friend.'"
539,"'I had had time to note these little particulars, and to mark the heavy
breathing and feverish startings of the sick man, before he was aware of
my presence."
540,"One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning
to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his
books."
541,"Who could continue to exist where there are no cows but the cows on the
chimney-pots; nothing redolent of Pan but pan-tiles; no crop but stone
crop?"
542,"We supposed he had now eased his mind, and told the worst he knew
of the cook; but, a day or two afterwards, his conscience sustained a
new twinge, and he disclosed how she had a little girl, who, early every
morning, took away our bread; and also how he himself had been suborned
to maintain the milkman in coals."
543,"‘I didn’t do anything in particular,’ said Traddles.
‘I lived with them,
waiting to be put out in the world, until his gout unfortunately flew
to his stomach--and so he died, and so she married a young man, and so I
wasn’t provided for.’
‘Did you get nothing, Traddles, after all?’
‘Oh dear, yes!’ said Traddles."
544,"‘By advertising,’ said Mrs. Micawber--‘in all the papers."
545,"'I wonder whereabouts in Bath this coach puts up,' said Mr. Pickwick,
mildly addressing Mr. Winkle."
546,"'None, Perker.
Not a pound, not a penny of my money, shall find its way into the
pockets of Dodson and Fogg."
547,"I resolved
to do what I could, in a quiet way, to improve our proceedings myself,
but I foresaw that my utmost would be very little, or I must degenerate
into the spider again, and be for ever lying in wait."
548,"'I believe you are in the service of Mr. Pickwick, the defendant in this
case?"
549,"and all the
women groans again, ten times louder than afore.
I got rather savage at
this, so I takes a step or two for'ard and says, ""My friend,"" says I,
""did you apply that 'ere obserwation to me?"""
550,"Where’s Sikes, you thief?”
The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and
indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor’s
grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the
house."
551,"When
we came into the country road, she permitted him to relax a little,
however; and looking at me down in a valley of cushion by her side,
asked me whether I was happy?"
552,"And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses (canes he
made it that day, I remember), my mother burst out crying."
553,"(Cheers.)
Who was it that cried ""No""?
(Enthusiastic cheering.)"
554,"inquired Mr. Pickwick.
'I think he will,' rejoined Perker.
'If not, we must try the young
lady's persuasion; and that is what anybody but you would have done at
first.'"
555,"'Took a boy's leg out of the socket last
week--boy ate five apples and a gingerbread cake--exactly two minutes
after it was all over, boy said he wouldn't lie there to be made game
of, and he'd tell his mother if they didn't begin.'"
556,"No; it could not have been the fat boy;
there was not a gleam of mirth, or anything but feeding in his whole
visage."
557,"It was dark in the morning, when I got upon the coach at the inn door."
558,"“Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to
go with me."
559,"If I
might take the liberty of saying so, sir, I don’t think the milk which
is boiled with it is quite genuine; but I am aware, sir, that there is
a great adulteration of milk, in London, and that the article in a pure
state is difficult to be obtained.’
It appeared to me that the gentleman in spectacles backed his Twenty
Eight against Mr. Creakle’s Twenty Seven, for each of them took his own
man in hand."
560,"I’m a
poor scholar, but I shall write to you, odd times, when you’re away, and
send my letters to Mas’r Davy."
561,"Then she would open it at
the place where Jip had made it illegible last night, and call Jip
up, to look at his misdeeds."
562,"A young gentleman
may be over-careful of himself, or he may be under-careful of himself."
563,"‘Papa is
well.
You see us here, quiet in our own home; our anxieties set at rest,
our home restored to us; and knowing that, dear Trotwood, you know all.’
‘All, Agnes?’ said I."
564,"'Wot things?'
'Them things as is always a-goin' up and down, in the city.'"
565,"“Bister Sikes!” exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; “cub
id, sir; cub id.”
“Here!"
566,"Now the question is, what's to be done?'
'What have _you _done?'"
567,"‘Are they?’
‘No,’ returned Steerforth, ‘the advocates are civilians--men who have
taken a doctor’s degree at college--which is the first reason of my
knowing anything about it."
568,"'I
have rendered no assistance in this matter, beyond being present at one
interview between the young people which I could not prevent, and from
which I conceived my presence would remove any slight colouring of
impropriety that it might otherwise have had; this is the whole share I
have had in the transaction, and I had no suspicion that an immediate
marriage was even contemplated."
569,"I went down on my knees.
I plucked at my hair.
I denounced myself as a
remorseless brute and a ruthless beast."
570,"Papa was very
much depressed then, and more bowed down by care than ever you or I have
seen him; but he seemed relieved by this expedient of the partnership,
though at the same time he seemed hurt by it and ashamed of it.’
‘And how did you receive it, Agnes?’
‘I did, Trotwood,’ she replied, ‘what I hope was right."
571,"The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of
those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it
was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great
distance from his former lodgings."
572,"What business had
she to do it?’
‘Perhaps,’ Mr. Dick simpered, after thinking a little, ‘she did it for
pleasure.’
‘Pleasure, indeed!’ replied my aunt."
573,"“This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to ’prentis,” said Mr.
Gamfield."
574,"The Jew: perhaps
fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he
endeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of
the room."
575,"'Oh, it's quite impossible to dine at half-past eleven o'clock in the
day,' replied Mr. Pickwick, looking at his watch."
576,"Moreover, there was a band
of music in pasteboard caps; four something-ean singers in the costume
of their country, and a dozen hired waiters in the costume of _their
_country--and very dirty costume too."
577,"said the chairman.
'Because he can't,' said Mr. Grundy.
'You had better say he won't,' replied the chairman."
578,"But he had no opportunity of pondering over his love just then, for Bob
Sawyer's return was the immediate precursor of the arrival of a meat-pie
from the baker's, of which that gentleman insisted on his staying to
partake."
579,"I had always felt my weakness, in comparison with her constancy and
fortitude; and now I felt it more and more."
580,"And wen he come straight agin, the
watch and chain was gone, and what's worse than that, the old
gen'l'm'n's digestion was all wrong ever afterwards, to the wery last
day of his life; so just you look about you, young feller, and take care
you don't get too fat.'"
581,"After tea, we sat at the window--on the look-out, as I imagined, from
my aunt’s sharp expression of face, for more invaders--until dusk, when
Janet set candles, and a backgammon-board, on the table, and pulled down
the blinds."
582,"'Hollo,' replied the man with the white hat.
'Number twenty-two wants his boots.'"
583,"Your conduct is most noble, Sir,' said Mr. Pickwick; and he grasped the
hand of the magnanimous Pott."
584,"Theer come along one day, when I was out a-working on the land, a
traveller from our own Norfolk or Suffolk in England (I doen’t rightly
mind which), and of course we took him in, and giv him to eat and drink,
and made him welcome."
585,"Mr. Pickwick drew in his head again, with the swiftness
displayed by that admirable melodramatic performer, Punch, when he lies
in wait for the flat-headed comedian with the tin box of music."
586,"I hardly know which was the better pleased, Traddles or I.
‘It really,’
said Traddles, suddenly, taking a letter out of his pocket, and giving
it to me, ‘put Mr. Micawber quite out of my head!’
The letter (Mr. Micawber never missed any possible opportunity of
writing a letter) was addressed to me, ‘By the kindness of T. Traddles,
Esquire, of the Inner Temple.’ It ran thus:--
‘MY DEAR COPPERFIELD,
‘You may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation that
something has turned up."
587,"‘Not much,’ said Mr. Micawber, slightingly.
Wickfield is, I dare
say, a man of very excellent intentions; but he is--in short, he is
obsolete.’
‘I am afraid his partner seeks to make him so,’ said I."
588,"‘There have not been any since we have lived here,’ said my mother."
589,"'I am very happy,' said Fogg, softened by the cheque, 'to have had the
pleasure of making Mr. Pickwick's acquaintance."
590,"whispered Mr. Pickwick.
Serjeant Buzfuz,' replied Perker.
'He's opposed to us; he leads on
the other side."
591,"There let it rest.
We
have said enough!’
Afraid of offending him by pursuing the subject when he made so light
of it, I only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker
pace than before."
592,"The cobbler paused to ascertain what effect his story had produced on
Sam; but finding that he had dropped asleep, knocked the ashes out of
his pipe, sighed, put it down, drew the bed-clothes over his head, and
went to sleep, too."
593,"'Live and learn, you know.
They'll be
good shots one of these days."
594,"There is no trace of any, elsewhere.
It may be as
well for you to assist us, if you please.’
I had been in agony to obtain some knowledge of the circumstances
in which my Dora would be placed--as, in whose guardianship, and so
forth--and this was something towards it."
595,"'The womin,' said Sam, in the same tone.
'He ain't far out there, Sammy,' replied Mr. Weller; 'they _must _be a
soft sex--a wery soft sex, indeed--if they let themselves be gammoned by
such fellers as him.'"
596,"'Another double,' said the old lady, triumphantly making a memorandum of
the circumstance, by placing one sixpence and a battered halfpenny under
the candlestick."
597,"It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from
among the group."
598,"The dog sat at
the bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now
pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the
street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention."
599,"'""Why,"" replied the peasant, ""the foreign lady that our prince wished to
wed, is married to a foreign noble of her own country, and the king
proclaims the fact, and a great public festival besides; for now, of
course, Prince Bladud will come back and marry the lady his father
chose, who they say is as beautiful as the noonday sun."
600,"'Making a point!
What are
they pointing at?'
'Keep your eyes open,' said Wardle, not heeding the question in the
excitement of the moment."
601,"'How was it you worn't one of us, last night?'
inquired Sam, scrubbing
his face with the towel."
602,"Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes;
and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening “upon
liking”—a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that
if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out
of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for
a term of years, to do what he likes with."
603,"My aunt inclined her head to Mr. Murdstone, who went on:
‘Miss Trotwood: on the receipt of your letter, I considered it an act of
greater justice to myself, and perhaps of more respect to you--’
‘Thank you,’ said my aunt, still eyeing him keenly."
604,"I led the same secretly unhappy life;
but I led it in the same lonely, self-reliant manner."
605,"The mob hitherto had been passive spectators of the scene, but as the
intelligence of the Pickwickians being informers was spread among them,
they began to canvass with considerable vivacity the propriety of
enforcing the heated pastry-vendor's proposition: and there is no saying
what acts of personal aggression they might have committed, had not the
affray been unexpectedly terminated by the interposition of a new-comer."
606,"‘Well, well!’ said my aunt.
‘I only ask."
607,"So then they pours him out a glass of wine, and
gammons him about his driving, and gets him into a reg'lar good humour,
and at last shoves a twenty-pound note into his hand."
608,"'Dear me!'
exclaimed the old lady.
'I am so flurried, now I have got
here, Martin, that I'm all in a tremble.'"
609,"She
would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child
too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been
born, and was alive."
610,"‘Trot,’ said my aunt in conclusion, ‘be a credit to yourself, to me, and
Mr. Dick, and Heaven be with you!’
I was greatly overcome, and could only thank her, again and again, and
send my love to Mr. Dick."
611,"In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils.
Having prepared
his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the
companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was
now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would
blacken it, and change its hue for ever."
612,"'Beg your pardon, sir,' said Sam, suddenly breaking off in his
loquacious discourse."
613,"‘Brittles,’ I says, when I had woke him, ‘don’t be frightened!’”
“So you did,” observed Brittles, in a low voice."
614,"As he glided stealthily along, creeping
beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man
seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and
darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of
some rich offal for a meal."
615,"If his progress downward had been attended with
difficulties and uncertainty, his journey back was infinitely more
perplexing."
616,"The garden had run wild, and half the
windows of the house were shut up."
617,"On Mr. Pickwick's presenting himself at the bar, an elderly female
emerged from behind the screen therein, and presented herself before
him."
618,"‘I am well aware that I am the umblest person going,’ said Uriah Heep,
modestly; ‘let the other be where he may."
619,"‘We have
been discussing your emigration, with many apologies to you for keeping
you out of the room so long; and I’ll tell you what arrangements we
propose.’
These she explained to the unbounded satisfaction of the
family,--children and all being then present,--and so much to the
awakening of Mr. Micawber’s punctual habits in the opening stage of
all bill transactions, that he could not be dissuaded from immediately
rushing out, in the highest spirits, to buy the stamps for his notes of
hand."
620,"“Where is it?
Hand over!”
“Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,” replied the Jew,
soothingly."
621,"Now, my uncle was never
a fast thinker, and if he had thought all these things, I am quite
certain it would have taken him till full half-past two o'clock at the
very least."
622,"But we preserved an unbroken silence.
I
believed that she had read, or partly read, my thoughts that night; and
that she fully comprehended why I gave mine no more distinct expression."
623,"“Where are my
priwileges?”
“You’ll get your privileges soon enough,” retorted the jailer, “and
pepper with ’em.”
“We’ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to
say to the beaks, if I don’t,” replied Mr. Dawkins."
624,"'But, my dear Mr. Weller,' remonstrated Job.
'Down vith it!'"
625,"‘An escapade of a week or so.’
‘And how are they all?"
626,"‘Copperfield,’ returned Mr. Spenlow, with a gracious smile, ‘you have
not known my partner, Mr. Jorkins, as long as I have."
627,"She has produced some delightful pieces, herself, sir.
You may have met
with her ""Ode to an Expiring Frog,"" sir.'"
628,"How Mr. Winkle, instead of shooting at the
Pigeon and killing the Crow, shot at the Crow and wounded the Pigeon;
how the Dingley Dell Cricket Club played All-Muggleton, and how All-
Muggleton dined at the Dingley Dell Expense; with other interesting and
instructive Matters 8."
629,"“Well, so be it.”
“Ha!
ha!” laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this
concession."
630,"I
must make that MY care.’
There was a twitch of Miss Betsey’s head, after each of these sentences,
as if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any
plainer reference to them by strong constraint."
631,"I wonder sometimes, when I think
of it, what they would have done if I had been taken with an illness;
whether I should have lain down in my lonely room, and languished
through it in my usual solitary way, or whether anybody would have
helped me out."
632,"But the circumstance about
him which impressed me most, was, that he had no voice, but spoke in a
whisper."
633,"A fine firm fellow, with a will of your own.
With resolution,’
said my aunt, shaking her cap at me, and clenching her hand."
634,"(Cheers.)
He was a humble individual.
(""No, no."")"
635,"When I lie awake, I can sometimes hear strange shrieks and cries from
distant parts of this large place."
636,"He then
folded it up with great care, pressed it smooth between his two hands,
put it in his pocket, and seemed to put my aunt away with it."
637,"No face appeared, however; and being come to the house, and
knowing how to open the door, before dark, without knocking, I went in
with a quiet, timid step."
638,"How
brown you are!
How glad I am!
Upon my life and honour, I never was so
rejoiced, my beloved Copperfield, never!’
I was equally at a loss to express my emotions."
639,"After a
short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion.
He appeared
somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from
which he had first roused her."
640,"'Hush, hush!'
replied Mr. Weller; and as he assisted Mr. Pickwick to
dress, he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter."
641,"“Well, Oliver,” said Sowerberry, as they walked home, “how do you like
it?”
“Pretty well, thank you, sir” replied Oliver, with considerable
hesitation."
642,"Traddles still remained,
perhaps, but it was very doubtful; and I had not sufficient confidence
in his discretion or good luck, however strong my reliance was on his
good nature, to wish to trust him with my situation."
643,"‘Copperfield,’ he said, ‘there must be two parties to a quarrel."
644,"'I'll take care,' said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey.
'And, perhaps, my dear Sir,' said the cautious little man, 'perhaps if
you could--I don't mean to say it's indispensable--but if you could
manage to kiss one of 'em, it would produce a very great impression on
the crowd.'"
645,"With that gentleman's assistance, Mr. Pickwick
raised Ben Allen to his feet."
646,"Indeed!’ said my host, with much diminished interest.
‘Possibly.’
‘If it’s really the same person,’ said I, glancing towards him, ‘it
was at a place called Salem House where we were together, and he was an
excellent fellow.’
‘Oh yes."
647,"“There’s more than
one will go with this.”
“The sessions are on,” said Kags: “if they get the inquest over, and
Bolter turns King’s evidence: as of course he will, from what he’s said
already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the
trial on on Friday, and he’ll swing in six days from this, by G—!”
“You should have heard the people groan,” said Chitling; “the officers
fought like devils, or they’d have torn him away."
648,"This painful consideration operated so powerfully on the
feelings of the humane young man, as to cause his knees to knock
together, and his countenance to exhibit alarming manifestations of
inward emotion."
649,"‘Did she tell you why?’ I inquired.
‘I asked her, Mas’r Davy,’ he replied, ‘but it is but few words as she
ever says, and she on’y got my promise and so went away.’
‘Did she say when you might expect to see her again?’ I demanded."
650,"'Sit down; sit down.'
Mr. Trotter suffered himself to be forced into a chair by the fireside."
651,"'So I see,' replied Mr. Weller.
'Not to any young 'ooman, I hope,
Sammy?'"
652,"‘Bred them Suffolk Punches by wholesale?’
‘I should think so,’ said the gentleman."
653,"No man should have more than two attachments--the first,
to number one, and the second to the ladies; that's what I say--ha!"
654,"'You're wery good, Sir,' replied Mr. W., stopping short;--'perhaps a
small glass of brandy to drink your health, and success to Sammy, Sir,
wouldn't be amiss.'"
655,"A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised,
was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened."
656,"'He don't shy, does he?'
inquired Mr. Pickwick.
'Shy, sir?-he wouldn't shy if he was to meet a vagin-load of monkeys
with their tails burned off.'"
657,"A very brief conversation ensued.
The door was unlocked.
Mr. Pickwick
stepped out of the closet, and found himself in the presence of the
whole establishment of Westgate House, Mr Samuel Weller, and--old
Wardle, and his destined son-in-law, Mr. Trundle!"
658,"The first effects of the latter was the
strange delusion, founded upon a well-known medical theory, strongly
contended for by some, and as strongly contested by others, that an
hereditary madness existed in his family."
659,"There is something bulky in Peggotty’s pocket.
It is nothing smaller
than the Crocodile Book, which is in rather a dilapidated condition by
this time, with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across, but which
Peggotty exhibits to the children as a precious relic."
660,"Sammy must be careful.'
'How do you mean?'
inquired Mr. Pickwick."
661,"“He’s been to the other
kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here,
where he’s been many a time and often."
662,"In this house, and with this family, I passed my leisure time."
663,"“The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,”
said Mr. Bumble."
664,"I’ll talk to you presently.’
‘If there is a scoundrel on this earth,’ said Mr. Micawber, suddenly
breaking out again with the utmost vehemence, ‘with whom I have already
talked too much, that scoundrel’s name is--HEEP!’
Uriah fell back, as if he had been struck or stung."
665,"We name our fondlings in alphabetical order.
The last
was a S,—Swubble, I named him."
666,"And so you fancy yourself in love!
Do you?’
‘Fancy, aunt!’ I exclaimed, as red as I could be."
667,"And he was--honourable and manful--for two year
going on, and we was just the same at home here as afore.’
Mr. Peggotty’s face, which had varied in its expression with the various
stages of his narrative, now resumed all its former triumphant delight,
as he laid a hand upon my knee and a hand upon Steerforth’s (previously
wetting them both, for the greater emphasis of the action), and divided
the following speech between us:
‘All of a sudden, one evening--as it might be tonight--comes little
Em’ly from her work, and him with her!"
668,"How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar?
P’raps not be there at all."
669,"If he
is to get on in life, he must get on umbly, Master Copperfield!’
I never saw his mouth so wide, or the creases in his cheeks so deep, as
when he delivered himself of these sentiments: shaking his head all the
time, and writhing modestly."
670,"Mr. David,
for the sake of old times, do, please, try to help me!"
671,"Sit down.”
“I’m not well.
I told you that before,” rejoined the girl."
672,"As he spoke, he drew a
chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to
distress her."
673,"The next time you go out to a smoking party,
young fellow, fill your pipe with that 'ere reflection; and for the
present just put that bit of pink gingham into your pocket."
674,"'That's good sound argument,' said the placid man.
'Containing a position which I deny,' interrupted he of the dirty
countenance."
675,"‘Have I deserved this!
I,
who never have deserted you; who never WILL desert you, Micawber!’ ‘My
love,’ said Mr. Micawber, much affected, ‘you will forgive, and our old
and tried friend Copperfield will, I am sure, forgive, the momentary
laceration of a wounded spirit, made sensitive by a recent collision
with the Minion of Power--in other words, with a ribald Turncock
attached to the water-works--and will pity, not condemn, its excesses.’
Mr. Micawber then embraced Mrs. Micawber, and pressed my hand; leaving
me to infer from this broken allusion that his domestic supply of
water had been cut off that afternoon, in consequence of default in the
payment of the company’s rates."
676,"She
murmured, however, even in her reception of me, that she was out of her
own chamber because its aspect was unsuited to her infirmity; and with
her stately look repelled the least suspicion of the truth."
677,"‘It must be on someone else.’
‘On Dora?’ said I."
678,"Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did
not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his
companion to the second story."
679,"She was not alone; for on the other side of the fireplace,
sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair, was a man in threadbare
black clothes, with a back almost as long and stiff as that of the chair
itself, who caught Sam's most particular and especial attention at once."
680,"Mr. Pickwick had a great deal more to say, which he would no doubt have
said, very little to his own advantage, or the magistrate's
satisfaction, if he had not, the moment he ceased speaking, been pulled
by the sleeve by Mr. Weller, with whom he was immediately engaged in so
earnest a conversation, that he suffered the magistrate's inquiry to
pass wholly unnoticed."
681,"He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely
breathing, listened attentively."
682,"It was
torturing to me to hear them talk of occurrences in which I had had no
share."
683,"There are the
names, in the sweet old visionary connexion, David Copperfield and Dora
Spenlow; and there, in the corner, is that Parental Institution,
the Stamp Office, which is so benignantly interested in the various
transactions of human life, looking down upon our Union; and there is
the Archbishop of Canterbury invoking a blessing on us in print, and
doing it as cheap as could possibly be expected."
684,"For similar reasons I made no allusion to the skirmishing
plates upon the floor; or to the disreputable appearance of the castors,
which were all at sixes and sevens, and looked drunk; or to the further
blockade of Traddles by wandering vegetable dishes and jugs."
685,"He was to be another father
to him, and they were all to live together in a garden of roses, weren’t
they?"
686,"‘Drowndead,’ said Mr. Peggotty.
I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but had not got to the
bottom of it yet, and must get to the bottom somehow."
687,"Work’us, don’t be
impudent.
_Your_ mother, too!"
688,"But under this difficulty, as
under all the other difficulties of my journey, I seemed to be sustained
and led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her youth, before I
came into the world."
689,"Mr. Blotton was ejected but not conquered.
He also wrote a pamphlet,
addressed to the seventeen learned societies, native and foreign,
containing a repetition of the statement he had already made, and rather
more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned
societies were so many 'humbugs.'"
690,"He was no sooner strong enough to put his
clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and
a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him."
691,"And Mr. Sikes was right.
By dint of alternate threats, promises, and
bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake
the commission."
692,"Mr. Pickwick, sir?'
'Confidence is a great thing in these cases,' observed Mr. Pickwick."
693,"He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr.
Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from
Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey
was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole
matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in
endurance of the most intense suspense."
694,"shouted Mr. Pickwick, taking up the burden of the cry,
though he had not the slightest notion of its meaning or object."
695,"They are like actors: now a man’s a judge, and now he is
not a judge; now he’s one thing, now he’s another; now he’s something
else, change and change about; but it’s always a very pleasant,
profitable little affair of private theatricals, presented to an
uncommonly select audience.’
‘But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?’ said I, a little
puzzled."
696,"‘Two parties, of course!’ said Mr. Omer, nodding his head
retrospectively."
697,"“Of course,” observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, “I knew he was."
698,"'I should like to see his poem,' said Mr. Snodgrass.
'I should like to have seen that dog,' said Mr. Winkle."
699,"All
this was gall and wormwood to the heart of Gabriel Grub; and when groups
of children bounded out of the houses, tripped across the road, and were
met, before they could knock at the opposite door, by half a dozen
curly-headed little rascals who crowded round them as they flocked
upstairs to spend the evening in their Christmas games, Gabriel smiled
grimly, and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp, as he
thought of measles, scarlet fever, thrush, whooping-cough, and a good
many other sources of consolation besides."
700,"'If you'd sent word you was a-coming, we'd ha' had it repaired;' replied
the imperturbable Sam."
701,"There are very few moments in a man's existence when he experiences so
much ludicrous distress, or meets with so little charitable
commiseration, as when he is in pursuit of his own hat."
702,"‘Oh, how strange it
seems that Jip should be old!’
‘It’s a complaint we are all liable to, Little One, as we get on in
life,’ said my aunt, cheerfully; ‘I don’t feel more free from it than I
used to be, I assure you.’
‘But Jip,’ said Dora, looking at him with compassion, ‘even little Jip!"
703,"But a great cry, which was audible even
above the wind and water, rose from the shore at this moment; the sea,
sweeping over the rolling wreck, made a clean breach, and carried men,
spars, casks, planks, bulwarks, heaps of such toys, into the boiling
surge."
704,"Nancy.”
The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to
imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had
not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver."
705,"‘Done, sir.’
Minnie coloured a little, and the other two girls smiled at one another."
706,"Mrs.
Grayper’s going to have a lot of company.’
Oh!
If that was it, I was quite ready to go."
707,"As you certainly would be, in any contract you should make for yourself."
708,"Wardle stood
with his back to the fire, surveying the whole scene, with the utmost
satisfaction; and the fat boy took the opportunity of appropriating to
his own use, and summarily devouring, a particularly fine mince-pie,
that had been carefully put by, for somebody else."
709,"It may be profitable
to you to reflect, in future, that there never were greed and cunning in
the world yet, that did not do too much, and overreach themselves."
710,"And I looked so, I have no doubt.
‘Don’t it--I don’t say that it does, mind I want to know--don’t it
rather engross him?"
711,"'Wot do you mean by leavin' it on trust?'
inquired Sam, waking up a
little."
712,"“Officer!” said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, “what’s this
fellow charged with?”
“He’s not charged at all, your worship,” replied the officer."
713,"So far as an
overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter
inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called
sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is
going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are
really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate
themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and
imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost
matter of impossibility to separate the two."
714,"I
believe I must come back!’
He rose, and I rose too; we grasped each other by the hand again, before
going out."
715,"His friends might advise him, you know; now he is free.
You
yourself, Miss Wickfield--Copperfield--I--’
‘I have considered it, Trotwood,’ said Agnes, looking to me, ‘and I feel
that it ought not to be, and must not be; even on the recommendation of
a friend to whom I am so grateful, and owe so much.’
‘I will not say that I recommend it,’ observed Traddles."
716,"The little dog retreated under the sofa on my approaching
him, and was with great difficulty dislodged by the fire-irons."
717,"Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane,
and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round,
and still lingered about the same spot."
718,"'No, no--I'll do it--shan't be long--back in no time,' replied Jingle."
719,"I narrowly
escaped being run over, twenty times at least, in half a mile."
720,"Supposing I were desirous of establishing them comfortably as
man and wife in some little business or situation, where they might hope
to obtain a decent living, what should you think of it, Mr."
721,"“Is the downstairs door
fast?”
“Double-locked and chained,” replied Crackit, who, with the other two
men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered."
722,"'He has got his discharge, by G--!'
said the man."
723,"The lady as has taken the lodgings!'
ejaculated Mrs. Cluppins.
Master Bardell put his hands deeper down into his pockets, and nodded
exactly thirty-five times, to imply that it was the lady-lodger, and no
other."
724,"But
Mr. James, I must say, certainly did behave extremely honourable; for
he proposed that the young woman should marry a very respectable person,
who was fully prepared to overlook the past, and who was, at least, as
good as anybody the young woman could have aspired to in a regular way:
her connexions being very common.’
He changed legs again, and wetted his lips."
725,"My overcharged heart found the same relief, and I cried too.
THE BEGINNING OF A LONG JOURNEY
What is natural in me, is natural in many other men, I infer, and so
I am not afraid to write that I never had loved Steerforth better than
when the ties that bound me to him were broken."
726,"‘He’s as like her, Dick,’ said my aunt, emphatically, ‘he’s as like her,
as she was that afternoon before she began to fret--bless my heart, he’s
as like her, as he can look at me out of his two eyes!’
‘Is he indeed?’ said Mr. Dick."
727,"_That_ was
the last time.
I had no letter, and I never saw him more.”
“I went,” said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, “I went, when all was
over, to the scene of his—I will use the term the world would freely
use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him—of his guilty
love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should
find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her."
728,"'Capital game--smart sport--fine exercise--very,' were the words which
fell upon Mr. Pickwick's ear as he entered the tent; and the first
object that met his eyes was his green-coated friend of the Rochester
coach, holding forth, to the no small delight and edification of a
select circle of the chosen of All-Muggleton."
729,"How many winter days have I seen him, standing
blue-nosed, in the snow and east wind, looking at the boys going down
the long slide, and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture!"
730,"Mr. Bumble and
Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs
were not so long as his master’s, ran by the side."
731,"I had not thought of it on the occasion of my last visit,
but how strange it was to me, now, to miss Mr. Barkis out of the
kitchen!"
732,"I don't know what I should
do, Mr. Weller, if I didn't.'"
733,"Take example
by your father, my boy, and be wery careful o' widders all your life,
'specially if they've kept a public-house, Sammy.'"
734,"Not that one, I never
see that boat.’
‘Nor him?’ I asked her."
735,"It has reappeared to annihilate
me, all through my life, in connexion with all kinds of subjects."
736,"The ends of his white neckerchief were
twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes
into which his countenance was twisted, defy description."
737,"“Where did he come from?”
“Greenland.
Is Fagin upstairs?”
“Yes, he’s a sortin’ the wipes."
738,"'Who's that red-faced man, who said it was a fine morning, and nodded to
our counsel?'"
739,"'""How do you know my name, old nut-cracker face?""
inquired Tom Smart,
rather staggered; though he pretended to carry it off so well."
740,"Don’t ask me such a
thing.’
Her tone was so very earnest that I raised my eyes in surprise."
741,"One of our clerks, who was an outsider, used, in the height
of this contest, to sit with his hat on, that he might be ready to rush
out and swear before a surrogate any victim who was brought in."
742,"She ran along the sea beach, believing
the old boat was theer; and calling out to us to turn away our faces,
for she was a-coming by."
743,"Somebody said to me, ‘Let us go to the theatre, Copperfield!’ There was
no bedroom before me, but again the jingling table covered with glasses;
the lamp; Grainger on my right hand, Markham on my left, and Steerforth
opposite--all sitting in a mist, and a long way off."
744,"'They are fine fellows--very fine fellows; with
judgments matured by observation and reflection; and tastes refined by
reading and study."
745,"I waited for a
few moments, until he could give me his undivided attention; and then
proceeded to explain the precaution, that, it had occurred to me last
night, it would be wise to take."
746,"“The prerogative of a man is
to command.”
“And what’s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?” cried
the relict of Mr. Corney deceased."
747,"No power on earth
should stop me, while I was standing here!
Have I been silent all these
years, and shall I not speak now?"
748,"I’ll—”
“There!
He’s fully committed!” interposed the clerk."
749,"‘Not yet?
Hey?’ repeated Mr. Creakle.
‘But you will soon."
750,"But she hardly ever spoke--I question if she ever did--without
making some mention of him."
751,"'""I am sorry to hear you express your opinion
against marriages of affection, pa,"" said Bella, colouring a little."
752,"'You are stopping in this house, Sir,' said the indignant little man;
'you are intoxicated now, Sir; you shall hear from me in the morning,
sir."
753,"‘That’s not an answer, sir,’ said Mr. Creakle, ‘to my remark."
754,"'No, sir.'
'Then listen, if you please.
Can you hear me now?'"
755,"'Have you read the papers, Mr.
inquired the Serjeant.
Here again, Mr. Phunky should have professed to have forgotten all about
the merits of the case; but as he had read such papers as had been laid
before him in the course of the action, and had thought of nothing else,
waking or sleeping, throughout the two months during which he had been
retained as Mr. Serjeant Snubbin's junior, he turned a deeper red and
bowed again."
756,"from the officers of the court.
Looking round, he found that
this was caused by the entrance of the judge."
757,"'Are there any people here who run on errands, and so forth?'"
758,"‘Now, my dear Dora, you must know that I never said that!’
‘You said, I wasn’t comfortable!’ cried Dora."
759,"“I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,” said Mr. Grimwig,
“for I began to think I should get nothing else."
760,"'Master sent me over with the chay-cart, to
carry your luggage up to the house."
761,"‘No?’ with astonishment.
‘Not the least.’
‘No motive,’ said Mr. Wickfield, ‘for meaning abroad, and not at home?’
‘No,’ returned the Doctor."
762,"'Why, really,' replied Mr. Pell, 'you're very--.
Upon my word and
honour, I'm not in the habit of--."
763,"'More to be done with a hundred and fifty,' replied Mr. Jingle coolly."
764,"I was so curious to know, that I made up my mind to have it
out with Mr. Peggotty."
765,"“I—I knew nothing of that; I was going to
inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me."
766,"That he should succeed,
was no matter of surprise to me.
That she should struggle against the
fascinating influence of his delightful art--delightful nature I thought
it then--did not surprise me either; for I knew that she was sometimes
jaundiced and perverse."
767,"‘There, my dear!’ she said.
‘Now you know the beginning, middle, and
end, and all about it."
768,"Now,
do understand that I am entirely at your service.
I am ready to go with
Annie to operas, concerts, exhibitions, all kinds of places; and you
shall never find that I am tired."
769,"This
suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done
with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to
death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his
brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty
generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman
of that class."
770,"‘If you heerd,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘owt of what passed between Mas’r
Davy and me, th’ night when it snew so hard, you know as I have
been--wheer not--fur to seek my dear niece."
771,"I promised Traddles that he should hear Dora sing, and see some of her
flower-painting."
772,"Nor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they might have
been by the moving passages narrated."
773,"It was a green spot, on a hill, carpeted with soft turf."
774,"'""We are pursued!""
cried the young lady, clasping her hands."
775,"‘How can you be so aggravating,’ said my mother, shedding more tears
than before, ‘as to talk in such an unjust manner!"
776,"Damme, you couldn't treat me with less
respect if I was veneered."""
777,"I wouldn’t have him if
he was made of gold.
Nor I wouldn’t have anybody.’
‘Then, why don’t you tell him so, you ridiculous thing?’ said my mother."
778,"""John, John, don't you know me?""
'""Don't let her come near me,"" said the man, with a shudder, as she
stooped over him."
779,"‘On the contrary, my love,’ said I, referring to my watch, ‘it’s a few
minutes too slow.’
My little wife came and sat upon my knee, to coax me to be quiet, and
drew a line with her pencil down the middle of my nose; but I couldn’t
dine off that, though it was very agreeable."
780,"'Well, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'then I wish the artists would come."
781,"'""Therefore,"" resumed the old gentleman, in a dictatorial tone, ""you
shall have her, and he shall not."""
782,"A
strange voice, too!
To whom could it belong?
They rushed into the
kitchen, whither the truants had repaired, and at once obtained rather
more than a glimmering of the real state of the case."
783,"And yet my thoughts were idle; not intent on the calamity that weighed
upon my heart, but idly loitering near it."
784,"She’s just the person as would put my Agnes up
to higher sort of game."
785,"The sun—the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new
life, and hope, and freshness to man—burst upon the crowded city in
clear and radiant glory."
786,"'Ven is it expected to come on?'
'Either in February or March,' replied Mrs. Bardell."
787,"""I
was wrong; I ought not to have said so, my dear, either,"" said I,
patting her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could pat it,
""for your mother's was one, and so was yours."""
788,"“I can,” said Fagin, almost aloud.
“She durst not refuse me then."
789,"Poor Baby!’ mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon the
fire."
790,"Tommy
Chitling hasn’t won a point; and I went partners with him against the
Artfull and dumb.”
“Ay, ay!” said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated
that he was at no loss to understand the reason."
791,"I trust, sir, that I have never pointed the noble
instrument which is placed in my hands, against the sacred bosom of
private life, or the tender breast of individual reputation; I trust,
sir, that I have devoted my energies to--to endeavours--humble they may
be, humble I know they are--to instil those principles of--which--are--'
Here the editor of the Eatanswill _Gazette_, appearing to ramble, Mr.
Pickwick came to his relief, and said--
'Certainly.'"
792,"“Near, I hope,” said Charlotte.
“No, not near,” replied Mr. Claypole."
793,"WICKFIELD AND HEEP
My aunt, beginning, I imagine, to be made seriously uncomfortable by my
prolonged dejection, made a pretence of being anxious that I should go
to Dover, to see that all was working well at the cottage, which was
let; and to conclude an agreement, with the same tenant, for a longer
term of occupation."
794,"I went on foot to the
old house, and went away with a heart too full to enter."
795,"'Oh, dear, dear!
How adwersity does change people!'
said the lady,
looking upwards."
796,"I think I have made a start,’ said Mr.
Dick, passing his hand among his grey hair, and casting anything but a
confident look at his manuscript."
797,"On the opposite side sat a
bald-headed old gentleman, with a good-humoured, benevolent face--the
clergyman of Dingley Dell; and next him sat his wife, a stout, blooming
old lady, who looked as if she were well skilled, not only in the art
and mystery of manufacturing home-made cordials greatly to other
people's satisfaction, but of tasting them occasionally very much to her
own."
798,"Joy and
grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears: for even
grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender
recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character
of pain."
799,"Better be umble, as you
always was.’
He remained for a little, biting the handkerchief, and then said to me
with a scowl:
‘What more have you got to bring forward?"
800,"'Young grampus!'
said Mr. Weller.
'Oh, dreadful,' rejoined Mr. Muzzle; 'but that is the worst of country
service, Mr. Weller; the juniors is always so very savage."
801,"He was very close to
her just then, gentlemen, so he really ought to know."
802,"‘Better here
than in the streets,’ said my aunt.
‘He was born here.’
We alighted; and followed the plain coffin to a corner I remember well,
where the service was read consigning it to the dust."
803,"If you please.”--If I
please!’ cried Mr. Peggotty, rolling his head in an ecstasy at the idea;
‘Lord, as if I should do anythink else!--“If you please, I am steadier
now, and I have thought better of it, and I’ll be as good a little wife
as I can to him, for he’s a dear, good fellow!” Then Missis Gummidge,
she claps her hands like a play, and you come in."
804,"“Something may come of this before long.”
The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of
office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner."
805,"I was
standing close to him, looking at him; and still, with a heavy brow, he
was lost in his meditations."
806,"said Mr. Magnus; and then he repeated the sneer with increased
effect.
'But you shall answer it, Sir.'"
807,"‘As I have mentioned to Miss Trotwood, I am actuated by no
mercenary considerations; few men are less so, I believe; but Mr.
Jorkins has his opinions on these subjects, and I am bound to respect
Mr. Jorkins’s opinions."
808,"And here, some evil spirit cast in his way the opportunity for
his first, most horrible revenge."
809,"There was nobody at all
disposed to contest the point, as it happened; and so, on he went, with
his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, like a lamb."
810,"Job Trotter bowed low; and in spite of Mr. Weller's previous
remonstrance, the tears again rose to his eyes."
811,"Now my opinion is, that it came into circulation principally on
account of her sometimes saying, at the school, that if she was a lady
she would like to do so-and-so for her uncle--don’t you see?--and buy
him such-and-such fine things.’
‘I assure you, Mr. Omer, she has said so to me,’ I returned eagerly,
‘when we were both children.’
Mr. Omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin."
812,"exclaimed Sam, 'always a-goin' on about
werdicks and alleybis and that.
Who said anything about the werdick?'"
813,"‘It ain’t that she’s
not as pretty as ever, for she’s prettier--I do assure you, she is
prettier."
814,"“Open the
door, somebody.”
Nobody moved.
“It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in
the morning,” said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded
him, and looking very blank himself; “but the door must be opened."
815,"Really, my dear Sir, really;' and the little man took an argumentative
pinch of snuff, and looked very profound."
816,"‘I see him, Spyers,’ said Chickweed, ‘pass my house yesterday morning,’
‘Why didn’t you up, and collar him!’ says Spyers."
817,"A tender young cork, however, would have had no more chance
against a pair of corkscrews, or a tender young tooth against a pair of
dentists, or a little shuttlecock against two battledores, than I had
against Uriah and Mrs. Heep."
818,"Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle had each performed a compulsory somerset
with remarkable agility, when the first object that met the eyes of the
latter as he sat on the ground, staunching with a yellow silk
handkerchief the stream of life which issued from his nose, was his
venerated leader at some distance off, running after his own hat, which
was gambolling playfully away in perspective."
819,"He gradually picked up more
and more of it as we conversed with him; but, his very eye-glass seemed
to hang less easily, and his shirt-collar, though still of the old
formidable dimensions, rather drooped."
820,"He told me instead, with much rapidity, a good deal about her
skill, and her profits; and about her being a scientific cupper, if I
should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity."
821,"TEMPEST
I now approach an event in my life, so indelible, so awful, so bound by
an infinite variety of ties to all that has preceded it, in these pages,
that, from the beginning of my narrative, I have seen it growing larger
and larger as I advanced, like a great tower in a plain, and throwing
its fore-cast shadow even on the incidents of my childish days."
822,"That Mr. Dick supported her on
his arm.
That he laid his other hand upon the Doctor’s arm, causing him
to look up with an abstracted air."
823,"I went up there, hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the way
while I climbed the stairs; and, looking as blank and strange upon the
room as the room looked upon me, sat down with my small hands crossed,
and thought."
824,"The obvious suggestion was,
that the mottled-faced gentleman, being anxious for a song, should sing
it himself; but this the mottled-faced gentleman sturdily, and somewhat
offensively, declined to do."
825,"“Do you hear me?”
“I don’t know where,” replied the girl."
826,"How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of
uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to
guess."
827,"'Dingley Dell, gentlemen--fifteen miles, gentlemen--cross road--post-
chaise, sir?'"
828,"'Oh, yes, Sir.'
'Then _we_ are Blue,' said Mr. Pickwick; but observing that the man
looked rather doubtful at this accommodating announcement, he gave him
his card, and desired him to present it to Mr. Perker forthwith, if he
should happen to be in the house."
829,"The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news
that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and
establishing for himself a glorious reputation."
830,"Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had
ceased to vibrate."
831,"'Commissioner--head of the yard--great man--remarkably great man,'
whispered the stranger in Mr. Tupman's ear, as the charitable committee
ushered Sir Thomas Clubber and family to the top of the room."
832,"'There is no ""of course"" in the case, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, gradually
breaking into a smile, in spite of the uneasiness which Sam's obstinacy
had given him."
833,"'Very extraordinary!'
exclaimed the officer.
'Very,' said the gentleman with the camp-stool."
834,"I Enlarge My Circle of Acquaintance
     VII.
My ‘First Half’ at Salem House
     VIII."
835,"I fear not, my dear Sir; they are too clever for that, I doubt."
836,"'We had a little tea-party here, last night--five-
and-forty women, my dear sir--and gave every one of 'em a green parasol
when she went away.'"
837,"You know what honour he has always done me.
Not proud in his wisdom."
838,"My stripes were sore and stiff, and
made me cry afresh, when I moved; but they were nothing to the guilt I
felt."
839,"Miss
Trotwood, you had better stop this; or I’ll stop your husband shorter
than will be pleasant to you."
840,"I discard it.
Has that fellow’--to the man with the wooden
leg--‘been here again?’
‘No,’ was the answer."
841,"'P'raps he might ha'
throw'd a small light on that 'ere liver complaint as we wos a-speakin'
on, just now."
842,"She might at least have waited till to-morrow.'
'That's her malevolence--that's her malevolence,' returned Mr. Bob
Sawyer vehemently."
843,"At length, when this determination had been announced half a hundred
times, the old lady suddenly bridling up and looking very majestic,
wished to know what she had done that no respect was to be paid to her
years or station, and that she should be obliged to beg and pray, in
that way, of her own nephew, whom she remembered about five-and-twenty
years before he was born, and whom she had known, personally, when he
hadn't a tooth in his head; to say nothing of her presence on the first
occasion of his having his hair cut, and assistance at numerous other
times and ceremonies during his babyhood, of sufficient importance to
found a claim upon his affection, obedience, and sympathies, for ever."
844,"Even the
fact that no one knew his Christian name, seemed to form a part of his
respectability."
845,"‘I think I am earnest and
persevering?’
‘I am sure of it,’ said Agnes."
846,"We all felt that we had a part in the management of
the place, and in sustaining its character and dignity."
847,"She was so happy in it herself, however, and the other was so happy too,
that they made the evening fly away as if it were but an hour."
848,"Picking up his hat, he looked towards the
door.
“Are you going?” demanded Mrs. Bumble."
849,"The
coachman throws down the reins and gets down himself, and the other
outside passengers drop down also; except those who have no great
confidence in their ability to get up again; and they remain where they
are, and stamp their feet against the coach to warm them--looking, with
longing eyes and red noses, at the bright fire in the inn bar, and the
sprigs of holly with red berries which ornament the window."
850,"A glimpse of the river through a dull gateway, where some waggons were
housed for the night, seemed to arrest my feet."
851,"This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked
somewhat sternly in Oliver’s face."
852,"‘Do you waltz?
If not, Captain
Bailey--’
But I do waltz (pretty well, too, as it happens), and I take Miss
Larkins out."
853,"Miss Murdstone gave me her chilly finger-nails, and sat severely rigid.
Mr. Spenlow shut the door, motioned me to a chair, and stood on the
hearth-rug in front of the fireplace."
854,"It is
as certain as death.’
‘Or as certain as they used to teach at school (the same school where I
picked up so much umbleness), from nine o’clock to eleven, that labour
was a curse; and from eleven o’clock to one, that it was a blessing and
a cheerfulness, and a dignity, and I don’t know what all, eh?’ said
he with a sneer."
855,"I proposed to her to walk out with me; but
Mrs. Heep repeatedly complaining that she was worse, Agnes charitably
remained within, to bear her company."
856,"The horse no sooner beheld Mr. Pickwick advancing towards him with the
chaise whip in his hand, than he exchanged the rotary motion in which he
had previously indulged, for a retrograde movement of so very determined
a character, that it at once drew Mr. Winkle, who was still at the end
of the bridle, at a rather quicker rate than fast walking, in the
direction from which they had just come."
857,"All the little
changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there, were changed again."
858,"What would you have, sir?’
‘Oh, Trotwood, Trotwood!’ exclaimed Mr. Wickfield, wringing his hands."
859,"Whatever grounds of self-congratulation Mr. Pickwick might have for
having escaped so quietly from his late awkward situation, his present
position was by no means enviable."
860,"“Poor fellow!” said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly
endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale
lips; “you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will."
861,"I rest a
good deal of hope on her observing how useful I am to her father (for
I trust to be very useful to him indeed, Master Copperfield), and how I
smooth the way for him, and keep him straight."
862,"Here Mr. Weller jerked his head in the direction of Dorking
churchyard, in mute explanation that his words referred to the late Mrs.
Weller."
863,"Even when we’ve good
cards, Charley and I can’t make nothing of ’em.”
Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very
ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of
laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire
what was the matter."
864,"‘Now you see her,’ said Miss Betsey.
My mother bent her head, and begged
her to walk in."
865,"'A-do, Samivel,' said the old gentleman.
'Wot's a-do?'"
866,"“This,” said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence
notwithstanding, “this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a
spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d’ ye-call-him’s
grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this
morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that
ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his
life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.”
Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus
recommended to their notice."
867,"She’s the
faithfullest of creeturs.
‘Tan’t to be expected, of course, at her
time of life, and being lone and lorn, as the good old Mawther is to
be knocked about aboardship, and in the woods and wilds of a new and
fur-away country."
868,"So, bless her
old soul, she sat as upright as she could, in her great chair, and
looked as fierce as might be--and that was benevolent after all."
869,"She and her father came
together.
I was not much surprised to hear from her that she had engaged
to find a lodging in the neighbourhood for Mrs. Heep, whose rheumatic
complaint required change of air, and who would be charmed to have it in
such company."
870,"You’d be surprised at the number of
people that looks in of a day to have a chat."
871,"‘Were you comfortable together?’
‘We were very happy,’ said my mother."
872,"‘We know our station and are
thankful in it.’
I found that Mrs. Heep gradually got nearer to me, and that Uriah
gradually got opposite to me, and that they respectfully plied me
with the choicest of the eatables on the table."
873,"The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.
“What’s the matter with you, porochial Dick?” inquired Mr. Bumble, with
well-timed jocularity."
874,"Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat
himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the
arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face."
875,"Kiss her!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.
“Faugh!”
“I didn’t mean to do it!” said Noah, blubbering."
876,"‘Now, Clara my dear,’ said Mr. Murdstone.
control yourself,
always control yourself!"
877,"The guard
and Mr. Weller disappear for five minutes, most probably to get the hot
brandy-and-water, for they smell very strongly of it, when they return,
the coachman mounts to the box, Mr. Weller jumps up behind, the
Pickwickians pull their coats round their legs and their shawls over
their noses, the helpers pull the horse-cloths off, the coachman shouts
out a cheery 'All right,' and away they go."
878,"It
appeared to me, on looking over the tradesmen’s books, as if we might
have kept the basement storey paved with butter, such was the extensive
scale of our consumption of that article."
879,"Thought Mrs. Bardell
fainted away on the morning in July, because Pickwick asked her to name
the day: knew that she (witness) fainted away stone dead when Mr.
Sanders asked her to name the day, and believed that everybody as called
herself a lady would do the same, under similar circumstances."
880,"The old gentleman fired by way of reply.
Down fell one bird, and
off flew the others."
881,"The spectral figures in the Dance of
Death, the most frightful shapes that the ablest painter ever portrayed
on canvas, never presented an appearance half so ghastly."
882,"I was very merry, I know;
but it was hollow merriment.
I attached myself to a young creature in
pink, with little eyes, and flirted with her desperately."
883,"I am very tired.
If this is sleep, sit by me while I sleep: don’t leave me."
884,"'No less a person, I assure you,' said the Master of the Ceremonies."
885,"said Bob, looking in at
the window.
said Mr. Pickwick.
'Why, we have only come nineteen miles, and
have eighty-seven and a half to go.'"
886,"It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker,
were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the
night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen."
887,"At last he reached a stone hall, which he remembered to have seen
when he entered the house."
888,"'Wot 'ud become of the undertakers vithout it, Sammy?'
Lost in the immense field of conjecture opened by this reflection, the
elder Mr. Weller laid his pipe on the table, and stirred the fire with a
meditative visage."
889,"Mr. Weller was then roused by his master from a sweet sleep of an hour's
duration; and, bidding adieu to Lowten, they returned to the city."
890,"And above all, there was Mrs. Leo
Hunter in the character of Minerva, receiving the company, and
overflowing with pride and gratification at the notion of having called
such distinguished individuals together."
891,"I waited, in the utmost
impatience, until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper’s (for it was
that identical neighbour), to ascertain if we could get leave to carry
out this great idea."
892,"''Cos if it is, jist you step in to him with that 'ere card, and say Mr.
Veller's a-waitin', will you?'"
893,"‘What are you talking about?’
Traddles looked at me, as if he wondered what I was talking about."
894,"And they stared so!
'What place is this?'
inquired Mrs. Bardell, pausing."
895,"Heep is here, sir,’ said Traddles, returning with that worthy
mother of a worthy son."
896,"Mr. Chillip was married again to a tall,
raw-boned, high-nosed wife; and they had a weazen little baby, with a
heavy head that it couldn’t hold up, and two weak staring eyes, with
which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born."
897,"Sometimes, I had proceeded restlessly from place to
place, stopping nowhere; sometimes, I had lingered long in one spot."
898,"If I didn’t support a aged pairint,
and a lovely sister,’--here the waiter was greatly agitated--‘I wouldn’t
take a farthing."
899,"Always
proceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth, as if the jaw were
locked and the face frozen up in pain."
900,"Presently he pulls up, all of a
sudden, and hollers out, ""Where is the sinner; where is the mis'rable
sinner?"""
901,"I ought to have made it, perhaps, but
I couldn’t azackly’--that was always the substitute for exactly, in
Peggotty’s militia of words--‘bring my mind to it.’
‘Go on, Peggotty,’ said I, more frightened than before."
902,"What are you doing here?”
The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently."
903,"In which the
old Man launches forth into his favourite Theme, and relates a Story
about a queer Client 22."
904,"At the sight of this
phenomenon, the fat boy uttered an interjection, the ladies a scream,
and the gentleman an oath, almost simultaneously."
905,"I looked at her again by and by, and
saw her shrink into her corner, and put her gloved hand to her forehead."
906,"His wounded arm, bound
and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon
the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed
over the pillow."
907,"We went into the town, and took our burden to the inn.
So soon as I
could at all collect my thoughts, I sent for Joram, and begged him to
provide me a conveyance in which it could be got to London in the night."
908,"‘That’s not it?’ said I.
‘That ship-looking thing?’
‘That’s it, Mas’r Davy,’ returned Ham."
909,"'That's wery kind on 'em,' replied Sam.
'And you know,' resumed Mr. John Smauker, with an air of sublime
protection--'you know, as you're a stranger, perhaps, they'll be rather
hard upon you at first.'"
910,"Her appearance was exactly what I have described it, when I first saw
her; but the society of the two ladies was so agreeable, and came so
natural to me, that I felt myself falling a little in love with her."
911,"The husband, whose name was
Thomas Benjamin, had taken out his marriage licence as Thomas only;
suppressing the Benjamin, in case he should not find himself as
comfortable as he expected."
912,"At Serjeant's Inn Coffee-house the whole party halted to refresh,
and, the legal arrangements being completed, the procession moved on
again."
913,"‘That
trying climate!--like living, they tell me, on a sand-heap, underneath
a burning-glass!"
914,"Oh, that he is!'
said the fat boy, joining in the conversation; 'don't
he breed nice pork!'"
915,"It runs in our family, gentleman--so am I.
'Many were the devices which my uncle practised, to attract the lady's
attention, or at all events, to engage the mysterious gentlemen in
conversation."
916,"‘Well, sir,’ said Mr. Omer, removing his pipe, that he might rub his
chin: ‘I tell you truly, I shall be glad when her marriage has taken
place.’
‘Why so?’ I inquired."
917,"The local influence of my
family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department,
for a man of Mr. Micawber’s abilities."
918,"‘Couldn’t have
done it!
Is that YOUR knowledge of life?"
919,"He was roused from a meditation on
these dire imaginings by the sudden appearance of two figures at a turn
of the lane."
920,"“It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors
should!” replied the girl."
921,"I deigned to make him no reply; and, taking up my hat, was going out to
bed, when he came between me and the door."
922,"He's
been running odd jobs, and that, for the last two months."
923,"“Oh, you little un-grate-ful,
mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!” And between every syllable, Charlotte
gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream,
for the benefit of society."
924,"said Sam, reciprocating all the old gentleman's grins.
'In the snuggery,' rejoined Mr. Weller."
925,"'Dear _me_ I vish it vos, my dear,' replied Sam, dropping behind, to let
his master get out of hearing."
926,"‘Doen’t be down!
Cheer up, for
your own self, on’y a little bit, and see if a good deal more doen’t
come nat’ral!’
‘Not to me, Dan’l,’ returned Mrs. Gummidge."
927,"WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN
CHECK
Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came."
928,"Then he’s not--but of course he can’t be, if he’s really
conscientious."
929,"One mast was broken short off, six or eight feet from the deck, and lay
over the side, entangled in a maze of sail and rigging; and all that
ruin, as the ship rolled and beat--which she did without a moment’s
pause, and with a violence quite inconceivable--beat the side as if it
would stave it in."
930,"“No,” replied Fagin, “not very.
He was charged with attempting to pick
a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,—his own, my dear,
his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it."
931,"Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and
they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place
of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered."
932,"From the circumstance of two sturdy little
boys having been repeatedly seen at the gate of the back garden, there
is reason to suppose that Sam has some family."
933,"I can
guess!’ cried Mrs. Gummidge.
‘But my parting words under this roof is,
I shall go into the house and die, if I am not took."
934,"Not that this would have worried him
much, anyway--he was a mighty free and easy, roving, devil-may-care sort
of person, was my uncle, gentlemen."
935,"He drew me closer to him, as he said in a deep alarmed whisper,
""Jem, she must be an evil spirit--a devil!"
936,"Why, my poor old mother, here, used to sit before this fireplace upon
that little stool when she was a girl; didn't you, mother?'"
937,"‘A beggar would be no novelty,’ said Steerforth; ‘but it is a strange
thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight.’
‘Why?’ I asked."
938,"Why don't he marry her?'
'Ah,' said Sam, 'to be sure; that's the question.'"
939,"And beside him, white with rage or
fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted
him in the inn-yard."
940,"The well-known shops, however, with their cheerful lights, did something
for me; and when I alighted at the door of the Gray’s Inn Coffee-house,
I had recovered my spirits."
941,"‘They are only opened in both shells,’ said I.
‘Take the top one off, my
love.’
‘But it won’t come off!’ said Dora, trying very hard, and looking very
much distressed."
942,"I know I have not the thankful heart, sometimes,
I ought to have!’
‘Yes, yes, you have, I’m sure,’ said Ham."
943,"‘No, of course not,’ retorted the Old Soldier.
‘Take your Dictionary,
for example."
944,"When Mrs. Nupkins dried up her tears, Miss Nupkins dried up hers, and
Mr. Nupkins was very glad to settle the matter as Mrs. Nupkins had
proposed."
945,"‘You’re a pretty fellow!’ said Miss Mowcher, after a brief inspection."
946,"When I had closed the door, and followed, with the umbrella
in my hand, I found her sitting on the corner of the fender--it was a
low iron one, with two flat bars at top to stand plates upon--in the
shadow of the boiler, swaying herself backwards and forwards, and
chafing her hands upon her knees like a person in pain."
947,"I often tell her that when she gets a little older she'll
be quite frightful."
948,"“Hem!” said the gentleman.
“No, I know you’re not."
949,"There was a lean and
haggard woman, too--a prisoner's wife--who was watering, with great
solicitude, the wretched stump of a dried-up, withered plant, which, it
was plain to see, could never send forth a green leaf again--too true an
emblem, perhaps, of the office she had come there to discharge."
950,"'What papers are those?'
inquired Mr. Pickwick, as the little man
deposited on the table a small bundle of documents tied with red tape."
951,"'Good-
morning, sir.'
'You're a soft customer, you are; we've got it all out o' you, anyhow,'
thought Mr. Weller, as Job walked away."
952,"The silence was at length broken by Mr.
Tupman.
'Dodson and Fogg,' he repeated mechanically."
953,"It was the critical moment of Oliver’s fate.
If the inkstand had been
where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen
into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been
straightway hurried off."
954,"very much so, indeed,” said Rose, interrupting him; “but there is
a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.”
“Ah!"
955,"'Jump in--jump in!'
cried old Wardle, climbing into the chaise, pulling
up the steps, and slamming the door after him."
956,"I shall
never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy,
and so forth, in connexion with that life, any more.’
‘And you will be right,’ said Mrs. Steerforth."
957,"“I ask you again,” thundered the doctor, “are you, on your solemn
oaths, able to identify that boy?”
Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at
Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the
reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the
doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at
the same moment, the sound of wheels."
958,"I believe I state
your views correctly; do I not, my dear Sir?'"
959,"(Cheers.)
Every gentleman who hears me, is probably acquainted
with the reply made by an individual, who--to use an ordinary figure of
speech--""hung out"" in a tub, to the emperor Alexander:--""if I were not
Diogenes,"" said he, ""I would be Alexander."""
960,"“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Oliver at length: seeing that no other
visitor made his appearance; “did you knock?”
“I kicked,” replied the charity-boy."
961,"He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry;
but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and
knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the
more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess."
962,"said Mr. Pickwick, turning warmly upon him.
'Oh, of course there is no reason why you shouldn't wear them,'
responded Mr. Tupman."
963,"The gauntlet, to which Mrs.
Micawber referred upon a former occasion, being thrown down in the form
of an advertisement, was taken up by my friend Heep, and led to a mutual
recognition."
964,"“What’s the matter here!” said Fagin, looking round."
965,"It was two or three hours past midnight when I got home.
I found my
aunt, in our house, sitting up for me."
966,"Altogether, I have never,
on any occasion, made one at such a cosey, dosey, old-fashioned,
time-forgotten, sleepy-headed little family-party in all my life; and
I felt it would be quite a soothing opiate to belong to it in any
character--except perhaps as a suitor."
967,"My compliments to Miss Trotwood, I am getting on very well
indeed.’
I was going away, when he directed my attention to the kite."
968,"Doctor
Mell, in a speech replete with feeling, then proposed “Our distinguished
Guest, the ornament of our town."
969,"Em’ly’s alive!’
He put his hand down firmly on the table, and set his sunburnt face into
a resolute expression."
970,"She had not yet sufficiently recovered from her agitation to be quite
prepared for the visit we had to make."
971,"‘I an’t what I could wish myself to be,’ said Mrs. Gummidge."
972,"'Oh, no; certainly not,' replied Mr. Winkle.
'Has his behaviour, when females have been in the case, always been that
of a man, who, having attained a pretty advanced period of life, content
with his own occupations and amusements, treats them only as a father
might his daughters?'"
973,"So just to prevent his losing it again, she put it on for him."
974,"Is it really, though?’
I replied that I liked it well enough, but that I certainly could not
claim so much for it."
975,"Not that they had ever quarrelled (Miss Mills informed me); but that
having been, on the occasion of Dora’s christening, invited to tea, when
they considered themselves privileged to be invited to dinner, they
had expressed their opinion in writing, that it was ‘better for the
happiness of all parties’ that they should stay away."
976,"“When I says I will, I means I will,” replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly."
977,"But going on, too, working pretty hard, and busily
keeping red-hot all the irons I now had in the fire, I would sit
sometimes of a night, opposite my aunt, thinking how I had frightened
Dora that time, and how I could best make my way with a guitar-case
through the forest of difficulty, until I used to fancy that my head was
turning quite grey."
978,"You must not think my visit all friendly
and disinterested, Trotwood, for--I am afraid I may be cruelly
prejudiced--I do not like to let papa go away alone, with him.’ ‘Does he
exercise the same influence over Mr. Wickfield still, Agnes?’
Agnes shook her head."
979,"But his easy, spirited good humour; his genial manner, his handsome
looks, his natural gift of adapting himself to whomsoever he pleased,
and making direct, when he cared to do it, to the main point of interest
in anybody’s heart; bound her to him wholly in five minutes."
980,"On his head he wore one of the common
eighteenpenny French skull-caps, with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom,
very happily in keeping with a common fustian coat."
981,"I
don’t defend myself, but I know well, and he knows well, or he will know
when he comes to die, and his mind is troubled with it, that he used all
his power to deceive me, and that I believed him, trusted him, and loved
him!’
Rosa Dartle sprang up from her seat; recoiled; and in recoiling struck
at her, with a face of such malignity, so darkened and disfigured by
passion, that I had almost thrown myself between them."
982,"“One more,” pursued the beadle; “compose your darling feelings for only
one more."
983,"“Ah!” said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at
the feet of the dead woman; “kneel down, kneel down—kneel round her,
every one of you, and mark my words!"
984,"I say it ain’t likely, in a man who knows his wind will
go, when it DOES go, as if a pair of bellows was cut open; and that man
a grandfather,’ said Mr. Omer."
985,"A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that
burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and
rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks."
986,"It always gave me pain to observe that
Steerforth treated him with systematic disparagement, and seldom lost
an occasion of wounding his feelings, or inducing others to do so."
987,"She held so
tight to him, in fact, that the officers were obliged to take ‘em
both together."
988,"‘You are no use to me at all.
You never run up
and down stairs for me, all day long."
989,"I wish you good-day, Master
Copperfield, and leave my umble respects for Miss Betsey Trotwood.’
With those words, he retired, kissing his great hand, and leering at us
like a mask."
990,"I was troubled by no doubt of her being very pretty, in any case; but
it fell out that I had never seen her look so well."
991,"When I came home in the afternoon, and
saw the bottles drawn up in a square on the pantry floor, they looked
so numerous (though there were two missing, which made Mrs. Crupp very
uncomfortable), that I was absolutely frightened at them."
992,"'Wot are you a-doin' on, you lunatic?'
said Sam, snatching the paper
away, as his parent, in all innocence, stirred the fire preparatory to
suiting the action to the word."
993,"‘He has
never said a word to me about it.
He knows better."
994,"Down they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstanding the
boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a very considerable
degree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, a propensity to upset
the tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery, and an irresistible
inclination to look at the clock, every other second, were among the
principal symptoms."
995,"‘Sit down,’ said Agnes, cheerfully.
‘Don’t be unhappy, Trotwood."
996,"'We owe you many apologies, ma'am,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'for disturbing
your domestic arrangements at so short a notice.'"
997,"'Far enough off, by this time,' replied Wardle, coolly reloading his
gun."
998,"Mr. Pickwick, feeling not a little disgusted with this dialogue, as well
as with the air and manner of the two beings by whom it had been carried
on, was about to inquire whether he could not be accommodated with a
private sitting-room, when two or three strangers of genteel appearance
entered, at sight of whom the boy threw his cigar into the fire, and
whispering to Mr. Price that they had come to 'make it all right' for
him, joined them at a table in the farther end of the room."
999,"‘This is my nephew,’ said my aunt.
‘Wasn’t aware you had one, Miss Trotwood,’ said Mr. Wickfield."
1000,"It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been
sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and
fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from
the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance
between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers
will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great
heroism on Mr. Bumble’s part: he being in some sort tempted by time,
place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings,
which however well they may become the lips of the light and
thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the
land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other
great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the
stateliness and gravity of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be
the sternest and most inflexible among them all."
1001,"There is no room to spare in the house; for more of ‘the girls’ are
here, and always are here, by some accident or other, than I know how
to count."
1002,"shouted the populace.
Amid these salutations, Mr. Pott,
smiling with that kind of bland dignity which sufficiently testified
that he felt his power, and knew how to exert it, got into the chariot."
1003,"I saw her do, that night, what I had never seen her do before."
1004,"His new friend departed; and, after
experiencing some slight difficulty in finding the orifice in his
nightcap, originally intended for the reception of his head, and finally
overturning his candlestick in his struggles to put it on, Mr. Tracy
Tupman managed to get into bed by a series of complicated evolutions,
and shortly afterwards sank into repose."
1005,"What were
Mr. Winkle's feelings when, in doing so, he disclosed to view the face
and figure of the vindictive and sanguinary Dowler!"
1006,"‘So you
have been at Yarmouth, Steerforth!’ interested to know all about it."
1007,"They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected;
but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes
and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights
of a town at no great distance."
1008,"When the wine came, too, I
thought it flat; and it certainly had more English crumbs in it, than
were to be expected in a foreign wine in anything like a pure state, but
I was bashful enough to drink it, and say nothing."
1009,"“Always interrupting, you are, partner!
This here Conkey Chickweed,
miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar,
where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and
badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was
conducted in, for I’ve seen ’em off’en."
1010,"I found it rather harassing to live in this
state of siege, but was too much afraid of Mrs. Crupp to see any way out
of it."
1011,"The wickets were pitched, and so were a couple of marquees for the rest
and refreshment of the contending parties."
1012,"There is the salaried clerk--out of door, or in door, as the case may
be--who devotes the major part of his thirty shillings a week to his
Personal pleasure and adornments, repairs half-price to the Adelphi
Theatre at least three times a week, dissipates majestically at the
cider cellars afterwards, and is a dirty caricature of the fashion which
expired six months ago."
1013,"And you
doen’t ought to watch and work both.
That won’t do."
1014,"'I don't know much about that 'ere,' said Sam.
'I thought they'd a wery
strong flavour o' warm flat irons.'"
1015,"'But I think, perhaps, if
somebody went down, just to see that he didn't dip his beak into the jug
by accident, or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he
came upstairs, it would be as well."
1016,"The
twilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as they
saw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the
fire."
1017,"“We want to sleep here
to-night.”
“I’b dot certaid you cad,” said Barney, who was the attendant sprite;
“but I’ll idquire.”
“Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer
while yer inquiring, will yer?” said Noah."
1018,"Mr. Peggotty
took the light from the window, trimmed it, put it on the table, and was
busily stirring the fire, when Ham, who had not moved, said:
‘Mas’r Davy, will you come out a minute, and see what Em’ly and me has
got to show you?’
We went out."
1019,"‘You are a young man,’ she said, nodding.
‘Take a word of advice,
even from three foot nothing."
1020,"There was some cursed
spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she
remained there and was happy."
1021,"He is not my private friend
and public patron, as Steerforth was, but I hold him in a reverential
respect."
1022,"'That has nothing whatever to do with the matter, Sam,' interposed Mr.
Pickwick."
1023,"Whether he could rush to the next assizes, and proclaim himself a
lawyer?"
1024,"She was not theologically instructed enough to discern very
clearly the relation between the sacred documents of the past which she
opened without method, and her own obscure, simple life; but the spirit
of rectitude, and the sense of responsibility for the effect of her
conduct on others, which were strong elements in Nancy’s character, had
made it a habit with her to scrutinize her past feelings and actions
with self-questioning solicitude."
1025,"She had brought up her children to wear
flannel and not to over-eat themselves, which last habit she considered
the chief reason why people needed doctors."
1026,"That’s what
I’m thinking on.
I’m a ’cute chap,—I am.”
“Mr Glegg, Mr Glegg!” said a severe voice from the open parlour window,
“pray are you coming in to tea, or are you going to stand talking with
packmen till you get murdered in the open daylight?”
“Murdered?” said Mr Glegg; “what’s the woman talking of?"
1027,"In the
rest of practical life he walked by hereditary habit; half from that
personal pride and unreflecting egoism which I have already called
commonness, and half from that naivete which belonged to preoccupation
with favorite ideas."
1028,"“But surely we should regard his claim as a much greater one, even to
the half of that property which I know that you have destined for me."
1029,"And there are some lessons I’m very fond of.
I’m very fond of Greek history, and everything about the Greeks."
1030,"It is time, too, for me to leave off resting my arms on the
cold stone of this bridge....
Ah, my arms are really benumbed."
1031,"“Positively,” exclaimed Mrs. Cadwallader, “there is a new face come out
from behind that broad man queerer than any of them: a little round
head with bulging eyes—a sort of frog-face—do look."
1032,"Stephen hardly knew what happened, or in what automatic way he got
through the duties of politeness in the interval, until he was free and
saw Maggie seated alone again, at the farther end of the room."
1033,"“I niver thought your girl ’ud
be so good-looking, Bessy.
But you must wear pink, my dear; that blue
thing as your aunt Glegg gave you turns you into a crowflower."
1034,"“Not immediately—no.
In order to account for that wish I must
mention—what it were otherwise needless to refer to—that my life, on
all collateral accounts insignificant, derives a possible importance
from the incompleteness of labors which have extended through all its
best years."
1035,"Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”
“A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into
electrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of
your cow-house."
1036,"“Ah, it’s as well not to say that, though; for you’d pass for a good
deal older, and age tells well in business."
1037,"The gamekeeper is not shot: that is
settled.
What is it, then?”
“Well, it’s a very trying thing, you know,” said Mr. Brooke."
1038,"The risk would remain
even with close knowledge of Lydgate’s character; for character too is
a process and an unfolding."
1039,"“You
might as well bet a man as he wouldn’t catch the rheumatise if he stood
up to ’s neck in the pool of a frosty night."
1040,"Maggie saw a cloud on his brow when he came home, which checked her joy
at his coming so much sooner than she had expected, and she dared
hardly speak to him as he stood silently throwing the small
gravel-stones into the mill-dam."
1041,"He is below.
I thought you might like to know he was there, if
you had anything to say to him.”
Fred had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking, because he could
not say, “You are losing confoundedly, and are making everybody stare
at you; you had better come away.” But inspiration could hardly have
served him better."
1042,"“Where do you begin, Tom?”
“Oh, I begin at _’Appellativa arborum,’_ because I say all over again
what I’ve been learning this week.”
Tom sailed along pretty well for three lines; and Maggie was beginning
to forget her office of prompter in speculating as to what _mas_ could
mean, which came twice over, when he stuck fast at _Sunt etiam
volucrum_."
1043,"And Fred could not but reckon his own judgment of a horse
as worth something."
1044,"For being the nature of great spirits to love
To be where they may be most eminent;
They, rating of themselves so farre above
Us in conceit, with whom they do frequent,
Imagine how we wonder and esteeme
All that they do or say; which makes them strive
To make our admiration more extreme,
Which they suppose they cannot, ’less they give
Notice of their extreme and highest thoughts."
1045,"He began
with some confidence.
“Gentlemen—Electors of Middlemarch!”
This was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed
natural."
1046,"“It is wicked—base—ever allowing a word or look
that Lucy—that others might not have seen."
1047,"He was at a starting-point which makes many a man’s career a fine
subject for betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that
amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an
arduous purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of
circumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man swims
and makes his point or else is carried headlong."
1048,"Having no money, and having privately sought advice as to what security
could possibly be given by a man in his position, Lydgate had offered
the one good security in his power to the less peremptory creditor, who
was a silversmith and jeweller, and who consented to take on himself
the upholsterer’s credit also, accepting interest for a given term."
1049,"Rosamond was perfectly
graceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had
not been roused to bestow on her would have perceived the total absence
of that interest in her husband’s presence which a loving wife is sure
to betray, even if etiquette keeps her aloof from him."
1050,"The last nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than
usual, for the Fetish on that occasion represented aunt Glegg."
1051,"I knew
he was extravagant, but I did not think that he would be so mean as to
hang his risks on his oldest friend, who could the least afford to
lose.”
“I was a fool, Susan.”
“That you were,” said the wife, nodding and smiling."
1052,"But if the Almighty’s allowed it, he means to punish him for it."
1053,"Mary started up and blushed.
“It always answers to reason with Fly,”
she said, laughingly."
1054,"But don’t you be getting too thick with him;
he’s got his father’s blood in him too."
1055,"And I’m not going again, Nick.” Here Mr. Raffles
winked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode."
1056,"As Will dwelt on
them with excited imagination, he felt his cheeks and ears burning at
the thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and Rosamond—at the
uncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel her dignity wounded in
having an explanation of his conduct offered to her."
1057,"And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their
powers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer
keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic
knowledge."
1058,"And the young man—that’s the Mr.
Lammeter as now is, for he’d niver a sister—soon begun to court Miss
Osgood, that’s the sister o’ the Mr. Osgood as now is, and a fine
handsome lass she was—eh, you can’t think—they pretend this young lass
is like her, but that’s the way wi’ people as don’t know what come
before ’em."
1059,"She did not answer immediately.
“You refuse?” said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in his tone."
1060,"It would seem as if we distrusted her—distrusted her,
you know.”
That Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument, did not tend to
soothe Sir James."
1061,"“He’s none so full now, the Floss isn’t,” said Bob, as he kicked the
water up before him, with an agreeable sense of being insolent to it."
1062,"“Nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and
running away before this slander, leaving it unchecked behind me."
1063,"“No, no, Camden, you must not lead Mr. Lydgate into a mistake about
_me_."
1064,"“No, no,” said Lucy, sticking them in her band, “you shall not have my
scissors again,—you have strained them already."
1065,"His earnings in his native town, where he worked for a
wholesale dealer, had been after a lower rate; he had been paid weekly,
and of his weekly earnings a large proportion had gone to objects of
piety and charity."
1066,"“No.”
“Then I must ask him!” she said, releasing her hands from Lydgate’s,
and rising to stand at two yards’ distance from him."
1067,"My uncle brought me the letter
that contained it; he knew about it beforehand.”
“I beg your pardon, if I have said anything to hurt you, Dodo,” said
Celia, with a slight sob."
1068,"She wants to do the lad good, and it might be a
fine thing for him."
1069,"Able men who have passed their
examinations will do these things sometimes, not less than the plucked
Fred."
1070,"Lydgate answered
curtly, no—he had work to do—he must give up going out in the evening."
1071,"He dared not look up at her.
He sat with his eyes bent down,
and as she went towards him she thought he looked smaller—he seemed so
withered and shrunken."
1072,"Our deeds are fetters that we forge ourselves.
2_d Gent._ Ay, truly: but I think it is the world
That brings the iron."
1073,"There was no odious cupidity in Mr. Borthrop Trumbull—nothing
more than a sincere sense of his own merit, which, he was aware, in
case of rivalry might tell against competitors; so that if Peter
Featherstone, who so far as he, Trumbull, was concerned, had behaved
like as good a soul as ever breathed, should have done anything
handsome by him, all he could say was, that he had never fished and
fawned, but had advised him to the best of his experience, which now
extended over twenty years from the time of his apprenticeship at
fifteen, and was likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind."
1074,"Everywhere he must sit a little
and talk about the child, and words of interest were always ready for
him: “Ah, Master Marner, you’ll be lucky if she takes the measles soon
and easy!”—or, “Why, there isn’t many lone men ’ud ha’ been wishing to
take up with a little un like that: but I reckon the weaving makes you
handier than men as do out-door work—you’re partly as handy as a woman,
for weaving comes next to spinning.” Elderly masters and mistresses,
seated observantly in large kitchen arm-chairs, shook their heads over
the difficulties attendant on rearing children, felt Eppie’s round arms
and legs, and pronounced them remarkably firm, and told Silas that, if
she turned out well (which, however, there was no telling), it would be
a fine thing for him to have a steady lass to do for him when he got
helpless."
1075,"And I’d a right
to tell him so, for it was true; and _he_ began it, with calling me
names."
1076,"Or even if Jack the Giantkiller, or Mr
Greatheart, or St George who slew the dragon on the half-pennies, would
happen to pass that way!"
1077,"“I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects
under each letter.”
Mr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have
an excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”
“No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies
meddle with my documents."
1078,"His face was not turned towards her, and this made it easier to say—
“But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject."
1079,“For God’s sake let us hear what it is!” said Sir James.
1080,"“Come, come,” he said, putting his double eye-glass over his nose, and
seating himself to take a general view while he rested, “you’ve got a
famous show here."
1081,"“Do you hear me?” thundered Lydgate.
“Yes, certainly I hear you,” said Rosamond, turning her head aside with
the movement of a graceful long-necked bird."
1082,"Silas frequently took his turn in the night-watching with
William, the one relieving the other at two in the morning."
1083,"Rather beaten on this ground, Mr Tulliver
proceeded to express his fears that the country could never again be
what it used to be; but Mr Deane, attached to a firm of which the
returns were on the increase, naturally took a more lively view of the
present, and had some details to give concerning the state of the
imports, especially in hides and spelter, which soothed Mr Tulliver’s
imagination by throwing into more distant perspective the period when
the country would become utterly the prey of Papists and Radicals, and
there would be no more chance for honest men."
1084,"It’s well known there’s
always two sides, if no more; else who’d go to law, I should like to
know?"
1085,"“It’s no use talking o’ that,” said poor Mrs Tulliver, almost
peevishly."
1086,"And now, for the last two days, the rains on this lower
course of the river had been incessant, so that the old men had shaken
their heads and talked of sixty years ago, when the same sort of
weather, happening about the equinox, brought on the great floods,
which swept the bridge away, and reduced the town to great misery."
1087,"Mr Riley was turning over the leaves of the book, and she could make
nothing of his face, with its high-arched eyebrows; but he presently
looked at her, and said,—
“Come, come and tell me something about this book; here are some
pictures,—I want to know what they mean.”
Maggie, with deepening colour, went without hesitation to Mr Riley’s
elbow and looked over the book, eagerly seizing one corner, and tossing
back her mane, while she said,—
“Oh, I’ll tell you what that means."
1088,"“It seems strange to me how many things I said to
you.”
“I remember them all,” said Will, with the unspeakable content in his
soul of feeling that he was in the presence of a creature worthy to be
perfectly loved."
1089,"I’ve no doubt he’d take your boy at a hundred, and that’s
what you wouldn’t get many other clergymen to do."
1090,"He felt thrust to a new distance from her, amongst the
circles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life."
1091,"“Not a bit,” said Mr. Solomon.
“And cutting up fine land such as this
parish!"
1092,"Yet when he had spoken he was rather uneasy as to the effect
on her."
1093,"Godfrey
waited, before he spoke again, until the ale had been brought and the
door closed—an interval during which Fleet, the deer-hound, had
consumed enough bits of beef to make a poor man’s holiday dinner."
1094,"He is
free to choose some one else.”
“Then I have fulfilled my commission thoroughly,” said Mr. Farebrother,
putting out his hand to Mary, “and I shall ride back to Middlemarch
forthwith."
1095,"But there’s a deal o’ things to be considered,
young man,” Mr Glegg added, looking admonishingly at Tom, “when you
come to money business, and you may be taking one man’s dinner away to
make another man’s breakfast."
1096,"You were as proud as proud,” said Mrs. Vincy, easily
recovering her cheerful smile."
1097,"Shall I bring you a bit o’ pudding when
I’ve had mine, and a custard and things?”
“Ye-e-es,” said Maggie, beginning to feel life a little more tolerable."
1098,"It is a painting of the Italian school—by
the celebrated _Guydo_, the greatest painter in the world, the chief of
the Old Masters, as they are called—I take it, because they were up to
a thing or two beyond most of us—in possession of secrets now lost to
the bulk of mankind."
1099,"We keep apart when we
have quarrelled, express ourselves in well-bred phrases, and in this
way preserve a dignified alienation, showing much firmness on one side,
and swallowing much grief on the other."
1100,"Apparently he was not without a sense that his freedom of speech might
seem premature, for he presently said—
“I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you, Mr. Lydgate,
and know you better than you know me."
1101,"“Oh, I
began that once; I read to where Minna is walking with Cleveland, and I
could never get to read the rest."
1102,"I have been set down as
tainted and should be cheapened to them all the same.”
Already there had been abundant signs which had hitherto puzzled him,
that just when he had been paying off his debts and getting cheerfully
on his feet, the townsmen were avoiding him or looking strangely at
him, and in two instances it came to his knowledge that patients of his
had called in another practitioner."
1103,"Tom had a profound contempt for
this nonsense of Maggie’s, smashing the earwig at once as a superfluous
yet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story; but
Lucy, for the life of her, could not help fancying there was something
in it, and at all events thought it was very pretty make-believe."
1104,"Along with the sense of danger and possible
rescue for those long-remembered beings at the old home, there was an
undefined sense of reconcilement with her brother; what quarrel, what
harshness, what unbelief in each other can subsist in the presence of a
great calamity, when all the artificial vesture of our life is gone,
and we are all one with each other in primitive mortal needs?"
1105,"Mr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate’s attendance on
Raffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of
Bulstrode."
1106,"Stephen hailed the vessel.
It was a Dutch vessel going to Mudport, the
English mate informed him, and, if this wind held, would be there in
less than two days."
1107,"To a
creature of Will’s susceptible temperament—without any neutral region
of indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that befell him
into the collisions of a passionate drama—the revelation that Rosamond
had made her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty
which his outburst of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for
him."
1108,"Let ’em go cutting in another parish.
And I don’t
believe in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of ruffians to
trample your crops."
1109,"But she had not entreated silence, and to
prevent Caleb’s blame she determined to blame herself and confess all
to him that very night."
1110,"I love Tom so
dearly, Luke,—better than anybody else in the world."
1111,"I wished to have you with us
in choosing them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he thought there was not
time."
1112,"There was nothing here, when he rose in the deep morning quiet and
looked out on the dewy brambles and rank tufted grass, that seemed to
have any relation with that life centring in Lantern Yard, which had
once been to him the altar-place of high dispensations."
1113,"But Mr. Lammeter beats ’em all for
shapes: you see he holds his head like a sodger, and he isn’t so
cushiony as most o’ the oldish gentlefolks—they run fat in general; and
he’s got a fine leg."
1114,"However, Mrs.
Vincy, who never willingly opposed her husband, lost no time the next
morning in letting Rosamond know what he had said."
1115,"She was going to have
room for the energies which stirred uneasily under the dimness and
pressure of her own ignorance and the petty peremptoriness of the
world’s habits."
1116,"Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was
brown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said,
just the sort of person for a governess."
1117,"His uncle Glegg, he felt
sure, would never encourage any spirited project, but he had a vague
imposing idea of the resources at his uncle Deane’s command."
1118,"Then, looking
round sadly, “But I shouldn’t ha’ minded so much if we could ha’ kept
the things wi’ my name on ’em.”
Maggie had witnessed this scene with gathering anger."
1119,"Lucy,
who had laid aside her black for the first time, and had her pretty
slimness set off by an abundant dress of white crape, was the
acknowledged queen of the occasion; for this was one of the Miss
Guests’ thoroughly condescending parties, including no member of any
aristocracy higher than that of St Ogg’s, and stretching to the extreme
limits of commercial and professional gentility."
1120,"Think about it.
You know he is going away for a day or
two to see his sister."
1121,"It’s poor work, changing your country-side.”
“But I doubt, Luke, they’ll be for getting rid o’ Ben, and making you
do with a lad; and I must help a bit wi’ the mill."
1122,"And I’ve made everything ready to change my mind, and
do as I like at the last."
1123,"You’ll be wiser another time, my boy.”
Whereupon Caleb drew down his spectacles, and proceeded to write his
signature with the care which he always gave to that performance; for
whatever he did in the way of business he did well."
1124,"I suppose there is not a clergyman in this country who has greater
talents.” Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked meditative."
1125,"He had done nothing
exceptional in marrying—nothing but what society sanctions, and
considers an occasion for wreaths and bouquets."
1126,"Meanwhile the indefiniteness
remains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one
would imagine from the sameness of women’s coiffure and the favorite
love-stories in prose and verse."
1127,"“Mamma,” said Rosamond, “when Fred comes down I wish you would not let
him have red herrings."
1128,"“Here’s your pretty bonnet,” said the younger woman, putting that
recently despised but now welcome article of costume on Maggie’s head;
“and you’ll say we’ve been very good to you, won’t you?"
1129,"“There is no time to spare, Tom,” said Maggie, as soon as Bob left the
room."
1130,"Lucy, always proud of what Stephen did, went toward the piano with
laughing, admiring looks at him; and Maggie, in spite of her resistance
to the spirit of the song and to the singer, was taken hold of and
shaken by the invisible influence,—was borne along by a wave too strong
for her."
1131,"Feeling
it necessary that she should be gradually accustomed to the idea of
their quitting the house in Lowick Gate, he overcame his reluctance to
speak to her again on the subject, and when they were breakfasting
said—
“I shall try to see Trumbull this morning, and tell him to advertise
the house in the ‘Pioneer’ and the ‘Trumpet.’ If the thing were
advertised, some one might be inclined to take it who would not
otherwise have thought of a change."
1132,"“Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, you should really keep back at
present, and not volunteer any meddling with this Bulstrode business."
1133,"It was one of the last
things her father said to Tom, that he must get back the mill.”
“Hush, you little puss,” said Mr Deane, availing himself of the
restored snuff-box."
1134,"Their sense of his usefulness would have
counteracted any repugnance or suspicion which was not confirmed by a
deficiency in the quality or the tale of the cloth he wove for them."
1135,"_You_ would,
Chettam; but not every man.”
“I don’t know,” said Sir James, coloring."
1136,"“Oh, yes,” he said, seating himself at the piano, “it is a way of eking
out one’s imperfect life and being three people at once,—to sing and
make the piano sing, and hear them both all the while,—or else to sing
and paint.”
“Ah, there you are an enviable fellow."
1137,"But he had come at last to create a trust for
himself out of Dorothea’s nature: she could do what she resolved to do:
and he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to
erect a tomb with his name upon it."
1138,"For the Squire’s wife had died long ago, and the Red House was without
that presence of the wife and mother which is the fountain of wholesome
love and fear in parlour and kitchen; and this helped to account not
only for there being more profusion than finished excellence in the
holiday provisions, but also for the frequency with which the proud
Squire condescended to preside in the parlour of the Rainbow rather
than under the shadow of his own dark wainscot; perhaps, also, for the
fact that his sons had turned out rather ill. Raveloe was not a place
where moral censure was severe, but it was thought a weakness in the
Squire that he had kept all his sons at home in idleness; and though
some licence was to be allowed to young men whose fathers could afford
it, people shook their heads at the courses of the second son, Dunstan,
commonly called Dunsey Cass, whose taste for swopping and betting might
turn out to be a sowing of something worse than wild oats."
1139,"The
shepherd’s dog barked fiercely when one of these alien-looking men
appeared on the upland, dark against the early winter sunset; for what
dog likes a figure bent under a heavy bag?—and these pale men rarely
stirred abroad without that mysterious burden."
1140,"Do you want to make an exchange?
You shall not have it without a fair barter.”
“I have some sea-mice—fine specimens—in spirits."
1141,"He was one of the rarer lads who early get a decided
bent and make up their minds that there is something particular in life
which they would like to do for its own sake, and not because their
fathers did it."
1142,"“Oh, please, Tom, have it; I don’t mind—I like the other; please take
this.”
“No, I sha’n’t,” said Tom, almost crossly, beginning on his own
inferior piece."
1143,"He went forward to meet his uncle,
prepared to suppress the agitation he must feel, whatever news he was
to hear."
1144,"why, they’d be none so heavy to carry.
Some tramp’s been in,
that’s all; and as for the no footmarks, and the bricks and the sand
being all right—why, your eyes are pretty much like a insect’s, Master
Marner; they’re obliged to look so close, you can’t see much at a time."
1145,"He’s wet through.”
Jem Rodney was the outermost man, and sat conveniently near Marner’s
standing-place; but he declined to give his services."
1146,"“No, don’t think that,” said Dorothea.
“I have no longings.”
He did not speak, but she replied to some change in his expression."
1147,"I am not resigned; I am not
sure that life is long enough to learn that lesson."
1148,"“You will not mind this sombre light,” said Dorothea, standing in the
middle of the room."
1149,"The aunts and uncles appeared to have been in warm discussion when the
brother and sister entered,—both with shrinking reluctance; for though
Tom, with a practical sagacity which had been roused into activity by
the strong stimulus of the new emotions he had undergone since
yesterday, had been turning over in his mind a plan which he meant to
propose to one of his aunts or uncles, he felt by no means amicably
toward them, and dreaded meeting them all at once as he would have
dreaded a large dose of concentrated physic, which was but just
endurable in small draughts."
1150,"“But there’s been no talk o’ jelly
yet.” Then after a moment’s pause she added, “There’s a dozen o’ cut
jelly-glasses upstairs—I shall never put jelly into ’em no more.”
Her voice was rather agitated as she uttered the last words, but the
sound of wheels diverted her thoughts."
1151,"“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily."
1152,"“Why, what book is it the wench has got hold on?” he burst out at last."
1153,"I’d keep him in
liver and lights for nothing—that I would.”
“Aye, aye,” said Mr. Macey, in the height of complacency; “our family’s
been known for musicianers as far back as anybody can tell."
1154,"And one
while he was allays after Miss Nancy, and then it all went off again,
like a smell o’ hot porridge, as I may say."
1155,"He said, with more feeling than
before—“Thank you—thank you kindly.” But he laid down the cakes and
seated himself absently—drearily unconscious of any distinct benefit
towards which the cakes and the letters, or even Dolly’s kindness,
could tend for him."
1156,"The first vision of
Rosamond would have been enough with most judges to dispel any
prejudice excited by Mrs. Lemon’s praise."
1157,"I was nurtured in the sense of privation; I
    never expected happiness; and in knowing you, in loving you, I have
    had, and still have, what reconciles me to life."
1158,"I will confess everything.
Lucy
will believe me—she will forgive you, and—and—oh, _some_ good will come
by clinging to the right."
1159,"Men may help to cure themselves off the face of the land
without knowing it,” said Will, who could find reasons impromptu, when
he had not thought of a question beforehand."
1160,"Sir James saw all the plans, and took one away to consult upon with
Lovegood."
1161,"We shall do very well—Eppie and me ’ull do well
enough.
There’s few working-folks have got so much laid by as that."
1162,"No, she
must wait; she must pray; the light that had forsaken her would come
again; she should feel again what she had felt when she had fled away,
under an inspiration strong enough to conquer agony,—to conquer love;
she should feel again what she had felt when Lucy stood by her, when
Philip’s letter had stirred all the fibres that bound her to the calmer
past."
1163,"They were not among those
who disbelieved their brother’s letter; but they had no confidence in
Maggie’s adherence to her renunciation of him; they suspected that she
had shrunk rather from the elopement than from the marriage, and that
she lingered in St Ogg’s, relying on his return to her."
1164,"The furniture for which he owed would not want renewing; nor even the
stock of wine for a long while."
1165,"He
took a wife, as we have seen, to adorn the remaining quadrant of his
course, and be a little moon that would cause hardly a calculable
perturbation."
1166,"Mr Glegg, who had contracted a
cautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behaviour
when the execution was in the house, was now warming into a resolution
to further his prospects actively,—some time, when an opportunity
offered of doing so in a prudent manner, without ultimate loss; but Mrs
Glegg observed that she was not given to speak without book, as some
people were; that those who said least were most likely to find their
words made good; and that when the right moment came, it would be seen
who could do something better than talk."
1167,"By half-past ten decorum demanded the front; until then Mrs Glegg could
economise it, and society would never be any the wiser."
1168,"How was he to live on without vindicating himself among people who
suspected him of baseness?"
1169,"The business was felt to be so public and
important that it required dinners to feed it, and many invitations
were just then issued and accepted on the strength of this scandal
concerning Bulstrode and Lydgate; wives, widows, and single ladies took
their work and went out to tea oftener than usual; and all public
conviviality, from the Green Dragon to Dollop’s, gathered a zest which
could not be won from the question whether the Lords would throw out
the Reform Bill."
1170,"Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming
symptoms in her charwoman, when Dr. Minchin called, asked him to see
her then and there, and to give her a certificate for the Infirmary;
whereupon after examination he wrote a statement of the case as one of
tumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out-patient."
1171,"There’s a lass for you!—like a
pink-and-white posy—there’s nobody ’ud think as anybody could be so
pritty."
1172,"There was a
little heap of them on the table in the bow-window—of various sorts,
from Herodotus, which she was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to
her old companion Pascal, and Keble’s “Christian Year.” But to-day she
opened one after another, and could read none of them."
1173,"Especially it was to be expected, as the
landlady of the Tankard had said, that he would recklessly cut up their
dead bodies."
1174,"“I have
taken the house now: everything else can soon be got ready—can it not?"
1175,"Mr. Crackenthorp, too,
while he admonished Silas that his money had probably been taken from
him because he thought too much of it and never came to church,
enforced the doctrine by a present of pigs’ pettitoes, well calculated
to dissipate unfounded prejudices against the clerical character."
1176,"Even the more definite scandal concerning Bulstrode’s
earlier life was, for some minds, melted into the mass of mystery, as
so much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue, and to take such
fantastic shapes as heaven pleased."
1177,"Packs is
come down i’ the world; I told you that; _my_ goods are for common
folks."
1178,"But Mary herself began to be more agitated by the remembrance of what
she had gone through, than she had been by the reality—questioning
those acts of hers which had come imperatively and excluded all
question in the critical moment."
1179,"He chose to go under the marquee to get a
glass of water, being hot and thirsty: it was empty of other visitors,
and he asked the woman in attendance to fetch him some fresh water; but
before she was well gone he was annoyed to see entering the florid
stranger who had stared at him."
1180,"I _may_ listen to that before I
go,—something you used to sing at Lorton on a Saturday afternoon, when
we had the drawing-room all to ourselves, and I put my apron over my
head to listen.”
“_I_ know,” said Philip; and Maggie buried her face in her hands while
he sang _sotto voce_, “Love in her eyes sits playing,” and then said,
“That’s it, isn’t it?”
“Oh no, I won’t stay,” said Maggie, starting up."
1181,"Rosamond, though no older than Mary, was rather used to being
fallen in love with; but she, for her part, had remained indifferent
and fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor."
1182,"“But then I am not a mighty man—I shall never be a man of
renown."
1183,"“My boy, you must get up this minute; I’ve sent for the doctor, and
your father wants you and Maggie to come to him.”
“Is he worse, mother?”
“He’s been very ill all night with his head, but he doesn’t say it’s
worse; he only said suddenly, ‘Bessy, fetch the boy and girl."
1184,"“At least—I ought not to ask—but I’m very,
very sorry.”
Philip turned to walk on, as if he had not patience to stand still any
longer, and they went out of the hollow, winding amongst the trees and
bushes in silence."
1185,"“No; there I can’t agree with you,” said Stephen, shaking his head with
sarcastic gravity."
1186,"Lydgate began to
feel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and one day looked down, or
anywhere, like an ill-worked puppet."
1187,"And I shall want to keep my mother and
sister.”
“Ah, young gentleman,” said Mr Deane, with that tendency to repress
youthful hopes which stout and successful men of fifty find one of
their easiest duties, “that’s sooner said than done,—sooner said than
done.”
“But didn’t _you_ get on in that way, uncle?” said Tom, a little
irritated that Mr Deane did not enter more rapidly into his views."
1188,"We’ll
be patient, my boy.
Callum shall go on with the books for a bit, while
you are learning."
1189,"That new inward life of hers,
notwithstanding some volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions, yet
shone out in her face with a tender soft light that mingled itself as
added loveliness with the gradually enriched colour and outline of her
blossoming youth."
1190,"But
I have prepared a charming surprise for _him;_ I shall have a glorious
laugh against him."
1191,"Maggie’s ten times
naughtier when they come than she is other days, and Tom doesn’t like
’em, bless him!—though it’s more nat’ral in a boy than a gell."
1192,"“And you planned to
murder him?”
“I did not plan: it came to me in the play—_I meant to do it._”
Lydgate stood mute, and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he
looked at her."
1193,"Rembrandt would
have painted her with pleasure, and would have made her broad features
look out of the canvas with intelligent honesty."
1194,"There’s heaps of your sort,
like so many pebbles, made to fit in nowhere."
1195,"He was not yet sure whether he should wait for Mr.
Garth, or use any good opportunity in conversation to confess to Mrs.
Garth herself, give her the money and ride away."
1196,"I think you’re like Samson.
If there came
a lion roaring at me, I think you’d fight him, wouldn’t you, Tom?”
“How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing?"
1197,"“Well, you pampered minion!” said Stephen, leaning to pull the long
curly ears that drooped over Maggie’s arm."
1198,"From the first arrival of the
young ladies in Tipton she had prearranged Dorothea’s marriage with Sir
James, and if it had taken place would have been quite sure that it was
her doing: that it should not take place after she had preconceived it,
caused her an irritation which every thinker will sympathize with."
1199,"So that when good Mr Glegg, restored to good humour by much hoeing, and
moved by the sight of his wife’s empty chair, with her knitting rolled
up in the corner, went up-stairs to her, and observed that the bell had
been tolling for poor Mr Morton, Mrs Glegg answered magnanimously,
quite as if she had been an uninjured woman: “Ah!"
1200,"This hope was not unmixed with the glow of
proud delight—the joyous maiden surprise that she was chosen by the man
whom her admiration had chosen."
1201,"I wish I were like you.”
“I’ve never been tried in that way,” said Lucy."
1202,"The deep-veined hands fingered many bank-notes one after the other,
laying them down flat again, while Fred leaned back in his chair,
scorning to look eager."
1203,"The next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions; it was
the mounting of the polished oak stairs, which had very handsome
carpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom, so that the ascent of
these glossy steps might have served, in barbarous times, as a trial by
ordeal from which none but the most spotless virtue could have come off
with unbroken limbs."
1204,"Not but what if you was sold
up, and other folks bought your furniture, it’s a comfort to think as
you’ve kept it well rubbed."
1205,"In
the mean time very unexpected things had happened, and there was to be
a family party at Garum to discuss and celebrate a change in the
fortunes of the Tullivers, which was likely finally to carry away the
shadow of their demerits like the last limb of an eclipse, and cause
their hitherto obscured virtues to shine forth in full-rounded
splendor."
1206,"It
may seem strange, but it is the fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision
of which Mr. Casaubon suspected him—namely, that Dorothea might become
a widow, and that the interest he had established in her mind might
turn into acceptance of him as a husband—had no tempting, arresting
power over him; he did not live in the scenery of such an event, and
follow it out, as we all do with that imagined “otherwise” which is our
practical heaven."
1207,"“I wish you would tell me that you could not possibly ever think of
him,” said Fred."
1208,"However, it’s no use saying that.
You will always think me a rascal
now.”
Fred turned round and hurried out of the room, conscious that he was
getting rather womanish, and feeling confusedly that his being sorry
was not of much use to the Garths."
1209,"“Marriage is a
taming thing.
Fred would want less of my bit and bridle."
1210,"But he had just heard something from Standish which,
while it justified these surmises about Will, offered a means of
nullifying all danger with regard to Dorothea."
1211,"I must get this sewing done.
It is for Rosamond
Vincy: she is to be married next week, and she can’t be married without
this handkerchief.” Mary ended merrily, amused with the last notion."
1212,"I would
never give way to that; I was always versatile.
But a clergyman is tied
a little tight."
1213,"We would rather work for our
money.
Besides, you say that Mr. Featherstone has lately given you a
hundred pounds."
1214,"The widow’s
cap of those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown
standing up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of
crape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing made her face look all the
younger, with its recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of
her eyes."
1215,"_You_ are not
resigned; you are only trying to stupefy yourself.”
Maggie’s lips trembled; she felt there was some truth in what Philip
said, and yet there was a deeper consciousness that, for any immediate
application it had to her conduct, it was no better than falsity."
1216,"But no feeling could quell Fred’s alarm.
“I could not be expected to give her up,” he said, after a moment’s
hesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of generosity."
1217,"To mercy, pity, peace, and love
    All pray in their distress,
And to these virtues of delight,
    Return their thankfulness."
1218,"Who are they, Sir James, do you know?”
“I see Vincy, the Mayor of Middlemarch; they are probably his wife and
son,” said Sir James, looking interrogatively at Mr. Brooke, who nodded
and said—
“Yes, a very decent family—a very good fellow is Vincy; a credit to the
manufacturing interest."
1219,"It’s a deal easier to do what pleases one’s husband, than to be
puzzling what else one should do.”
“If people come to talk o’ doing what pleases their husbands,” said Mrs
Tulliver, with a faint imitation of her sister Glegg, “I’m sure your
brother might have waited a long while before he’d have found a wife
that ’ud have let him have his say in everything, as I do."
1220,"She was certainly treating
him with more indifference than usual: she did not know how
affectionately indignant he had felt on her behalf up-stairs."
1221,"“Oh, that would not do—that would be worse than anything,” she said
with a more childlike despondency, while the tears rolled down."
1222,"“We all know how
Mr. Lydgate will vote.”
“You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,” said Lydgate,
rather defiantly, and keeping his pencil suspended."
1223,"She can stay under your roof, and in
the mean time things may come round quietly."
1224,"Maggie felt a beating at
head and heart, horrible as the sudden leaping to life of a savage
enemy who had feigned death."
1225,"run away,” said Mrs. Garth, seeing that Fred was
teased.
“Are Letty and Ben your only pupils now, Mrs. Garth?” said Fred, when
the children were gone and it was needful to say something that would
pass the time."
1226,"I suppose you
want a little sum to make a venture with.
But where’s all your own
money?"
1227,"“The dinner won’t
be ready till half-past one.
But if it’s long for you to wait, let me
fetch you a cheesecake and a glass o’ wine.”
“Well, Bessy!” said Mrs Glegg, with a bitter smile and a scarcely
perceptible toss of her head, “I should ha’ thought you’d known your
own sister better."
1228,"And that certainty was a terror.
It was not that he was in danger of legal punishment or of beggary: he
was in danger only of seeing disclosed to the judgment of his neighbors
and the mournful perception of his wife certain facts of his past life
which would render him an object of scorn and an opprobrium of the
religion with which he had diligently associated himself."
1229,"“You
must all come and dine with me to-morrow, you know—eh, Celia, my dear?”
“You will, James—won’t you?” said Celia, taking her husband’s hand."
1230,"“You’re always
setting yourself up above me and every one else, and I’ve wanted to
tell you about it several times."
1231,"I think it is enough that I
say you are not to go again.”
Rosamond was arranging her hair before dinner, and the reflection of
her head in the glass showed no change in its loveliness except a
little turning aside of the long neck."
1232,"The butler never knew his master
to want the doctor before; but would it not be right to send for a
physician?"
1233,"And I’m happy to say I was right; I’m
not often deceived."
1234,"Mr Tulliver, when under the influence of a strong feeling, had a
promptitude in action that may seem inconsistent with that painful
sense of the complicated, puzzling nature of human affairs under which
his more dispassionate deliberations were conducted; but it is really
not improbable that there was a direct relation between these
apparently contradictory phenomena, since I have observed that for
getting a strong impression that a skein is tangled there is nothing
like snatching hastily at a single thread."
1235,"We are indebted to that for his
being lodged in this neighborhood.
We are indebted to that for seeing a
woman like Dorothea degrading herself by marrying him.” Sir James made
little stoppages between his clauses, the words not coming easily."
1236,"But some of the visitors alighted and did not depart after the handsome
treating to veal and ham."
1237,"Another mile would bring them to Stone Court, and at the end of
the first half, the house was already visible, looking as if it had
been arrested in its growth toward a stone mansion by an unexpected
budding of farm-buildings on its left flank, which had hindered it from
becoming anything more than the substantial dwelling of a gentleman
farmer."
1238,"I quite envy your
acquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon.
Is she very clever?
She looks as if
she were.”
“Really, I never thought about it,” said Will, sulkily."
1239,"Rosamond obeyed him, and he took her on his
knee, but in her secret soul she was utterly aloof from him."
1240,"Money
had never been a motive to him.
Hence he was not ready to frame excuses
for this deliberate pursuit of small gains."
1241,"“Help me, pray,” she said, at last, in the same low voice as before."
1242,"But he made some enemies, other than medical, by his success with Miss
Vincy."
1243,"It was poor Mrs Tulliver who had hastened this catastrophe, entirely
through that irrepressible hopefulness of hers which led her to expect
that similar causes may at any time produce different results."
1244,"The Vincys had their weaknesses, but then they lay on the
surface: there was never anything bad to be “found out” concerning
them."
1245,"The change of movement brought a new consciousness to
Maggie; she blushed deeply, turned away her head, and drew her arm from
Stephen’s, going up to some flowers to smell them."
1246,"The two men were pitying each other, but it was only Will who guessed
the extent of his companion’s trouble."
1247,"“Maggie,” said Tom, confidentially, taking her into a corner, as soon
as his mother was gone out to examine his box and the warm parlour had
taken off the chill he had felt from the long drive, “you don’t know
what I’ve got in _my_ pockets,” nodding his head up and down as a means
of rousing her sense of mystery."
1248,"And I have no ill-will towards
Mary Garth, but there’s justice to be thought of."
1249,"I should be so loath for ’em to buy it at the Golden
Lion,” said the poor woman, her heart swelling, and the tears
coming,—“my teapot as I bought when I was married, and to think of its
being scratched, and set before the travellers and folks, and my
letters on it,—see here, E. D.,—and everybody to see ’em.”
“Ah, dear, dear!” said aunt Pullet, shaking her head with deep sadness,
“it’s very bad,—to think o’ the family initials going about
everywhere—it niver was so before; you’re a very unlucky sister, Bessy."
1250,"A strong
leading in this direction seemed to have been given in the surprising
facility of getting Stone Court, when every one had expected that Mr.
Rigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of Eden."
1251,"To Mrs Tulliver, when he got home, he would admit no difficulties, and
scolded down her burst of grief on hearing that the lawsuit was lost,
by angry assertions that there was nothing to grieve about."
1252,"It must be remembered that by
“business” Caleb never meant money transactions, but the skilful
application of labor."
1253,"“_I_ don’t care about the mill,” he said at last, with a sort of angry
compliance."
1254,"“It would be worth knowing by the
fact that Miss Vincy could tell it me.”
Young Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking that
Lydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it had ever
been his ill-fortune to meet."
1255,"She looked at Will with a direct
glance, full of delighted confidence.
“You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here
again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?” said Will,
trying hard to reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get
an expression of strong feeling from Dorothea."
1256,"And he had really given himself the trouble of recommending Mr
Stelling to his friend Tulliver without any positive expectation of a
solid, definite advantage resulting to himself, notwithstanding the
subtle indications to the contrary which might have misled a too
sagacious observer."
1257,"“Oh, come, this is a nice bit, now.
I did a little in this way myself
at one time, you know."
1258,"And so, notwithstanding the honest persuasions of Mr. Macey and Dolly
Winthrop, Silas spent his Christmas-day in loneliness, eating his meat
in sadness of heart, though the meat had come to him as a neighbourly
present."
1259,"I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a
barrister, since, they say, that is the preparation for all public
business."
1260,"The sky was heavy, and the trees
had begun to shiver as at a coming storm."
1261,"It’s the pudden.
I know
what the pudden’s to be,—apricot roll-up—O my buttons!”
With this interjection, the knife descended on the puff, and it was in
two, but the result was not satisfactory to Tom, for he still eyed the
halves doubtfully."
1262,"And those sovereigns wouldn’t help me
much—they wouldn’t really—if I were to take them."
1263,"Nevertheless, in her new humiliating uncertainty she
dared do nothing but comply.
She did not say yes, but she rose and let
Lydgate put a light shawl over her shoulders, while he said, “I am
going out immediately.” Then something crossed her mind which prompted
her to say, “Pray tell Martha not to bring any one else into the
drawing-room.” And Lydgate assented, thinking that he fully understood
this wish."
1264,"But,” he added, incisively, “I have to
consider what I shall do without it, not with it.”
Rosamond said no more."
1265,"These familiar flowers, these well-remembered
bird-notes, this sky, with its fitful brightness, these furrowed and
grassy fields, each with a sort of personality given to it by the
capricious hedgerows,—such things as these are the mother-tongue of our
imagination, the language that is laden with all the subtle,
inextricable associations the fleeting hours of our childhood left
behind them."
1266,"This observation of hers tended directly to convince Mr Tulliver that
it would not be at all awkward for him to raise five hundred pounds;
and when Mrs Tulliver became rather pressing to know _how_ he would
raise it without mortgaging the mill and the house which he had said he
never _would_ mortgage, since nowadays people were none so ready to
lend money without security, Mr Tulliver, getting warm, declared that
Mrs Glegg might do as she liked about calling in her money, he should
pay it in whether or not."
1267,"He was silent a moment,
and then said passionately—
“We may at least have the comfort of speaking to each other without
disguise."
1268,"We heared tell as he’d sold his own
land to come and take the Warrens, and that seemed odd for a man as had
land of his own, to come and rent a farm in a strange place."
1269,"How could any duty
bind her to hardness?
Resistance to unjust dispraise had mingled with
her feeling for him from the very first, and now in the rebound of her
heart after her anguish the resistance was stronger than ever."
1270,"“But you can’t take your own time to die in, Brother,” began Mrs.
Waule, with her usual woolly tone."
1271,"And he has not
said so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the
gallery)."
1272,"“Surely I am in a strangely selfish weak state of mind,” she said to
herself."
1273,"A model
clergyman, like a model doctor, ought to think his own profession the
finest in the world, and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his
moral pathology and therapeutics."
1274,"How the guineas shone as they came pouring out of the
dark leather mouths!"
1275,"“I like you
very much.”
Will was not quite contented, thinking that he would apparently have
been of more importance if he had been disliked."
1276,"It is often impossible to account for
the precise moment of an attack—or rather, to say why the strength
gives way at a particular moment.”
Mrs. Bulstrode was not satisfied with this answer."
1277,"There was a coarse, dingy man, of whose face Tom had some vague
recollection, sitting in his father’s chair, smoking, with a jug and
glass beside him."
1278,"She did not say
that Tertius was unaware of her intention to write; for she had the
idea that his supposed sanction of her letter would be in accordance
with what she did say of his great regard for his uncle Godwin as the
relative who had always been his best friend."
1279,"And then she could not help remembering that he had
passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there
be any unfitness in the fact?"
1280,"He did not put it up, however, and
she thought that he was dropping off to sleep."
1281,"At last she said, without hurry and with careful
emphasis—
“I never could have believed that you would like to act in that way.”
“Like it?” burst out Lydgate, rising from his chair, thrusting his
hands in his pockets and stalking away from the hearth; “it’s not a
question of liking."
1282,"There’s no hurry about it for anybody but
yourselves.”
The Squire’s life was quite as idle as his sons’, but it was a fiction
kept up by himself and his contemporaries in Raveloe that youth was
exclusively the period of folly, and that their aged wisdom was
constantly in a state of endurance mitigated by sarcasm."
1283,"Rosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than her own—hurried
along in a new movement which gave all things some new, awful,
undefined aspect—could find no words, but involuntarily she put her
lips to Dorothea’s forehead which was very near her, and then for a
minute the two women clasped each other as if they had been in a
shipwreck."
1284,"That drawing o’ the lots is dark; but
the child was sent to me: there’s dealings with us—there’s dealings.”
This dialogue took place in Eppie’s earlier years, when Silas had to
part with her for two hours every day, that she might learn to read at
the dame school, after he had vainly tried himself to guide her in that
first step to learning."
1285,"But it ’ud be as well if Bessy ’ud
have the child’s hair cut, so as it ’ud lie smooth.”
A dreadful resolve was gathering in Maggie’s breast, but it was
arrested by the desire to know from her aunt Deane whether she would
leave Lucy behind."
1286,"“And pray bring with you the volume of Purcell that you took away,”
said Lucy."
1287,"“There
is a companionship of ready sympathy, which might get the advantage
even over the longest associations.” It seemed to Fred that if Mr.
Farebrother had had a beak and talons instead of his very capable
tongue, his mode of attack could hardly be more cruel."
1288,"But with the Catholic
Question had come a slight wind of controversy to break the calm: the
elderly rector had become occasionally historical and argumentative;
and Mr Spray, the Independent minister, had begun to preach political
sermons, in which he distinguished with much subtlety between his
fervent belief in the right of the Catholics to the franchise and his
fervent belief in their eternal perdition."
1289,"The difficult task of
knowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is
chiefly made up of their own wishes."
1290,"But
there is a lightness about the feminine mind—a touch and go—music, the
fine arts, that kind of thing—they should study those up to a certain
point, women should; but in a light way, you know."
1291,"I wonder, Mr. Mawmsey, with
_your_ experience, you could have patience to listen."
1292,"Perhaps no one
carried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had come
to a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken by
ever-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful
comforter."
1293,"It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was an abstemious
man, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no great interval
from the first was a surprise to his system which tended to scatter his
energies instead of collecting them."
1294,"His
sister’s disgrace was naturally a heavy blow to him.
It was to be hoped
that she would go out of the neighbourhood,—to America, or anywhere,—so
as to purify the air of St Ogg’s from the stain of her presence,
extremely dangerous to daughters there!"
1295,"For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till she felt ill and
bewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely."
1296,"Failing this, absurdity and
atheism gape behind him.
The collapse for Fred was severe when he found
that he held no more than five twenties, and his share in the higher
education of this country did not seem to help him."
1297,"“I should like to go on a
long, long while, just as we are."
1298,"“I mentioned to you
yesterday what was the state of my affairs.
There is nothing to add,
except that the execution has since then been actually put into my
house."
1299,"Stephen was not by her now; she was alone with
her own memory and her own dread."
1300,"There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the
town to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital."
1301,"Perceiving that
the tears are hurrying fast, she unpins her strings and throws them
languidly backward, a touching gesture, indicative, even in the deepest
gloom, of the hope in future dry moments when cap-strings will once
more have a charm."
1302,"“To put the matter quite fairly, they have other objections to him:—he
is masterful and rather unsociable, and he is concerned with trade,
which has complaints of its own that I know nothing about."
1303,"aye—what’s the use of talking about might?” growled uncle
Kimble, hastening out with Marner, and followed by Mr. Crackenthorp and
Godfrey."
1304,"Mrs Tulliver, foreseeing nothing but misbehaviour while the children
remained indoors, took an early opportunity of suggesting that, now
they were rested after their walk, they might go and play out of doors;
and aunt Pullet gave permission, only enjoining them not to go off the
paved walks in the garden, and if they wanted to see the poultry fed,
to view them from a distance on the horse-block; a restriction which
had been imposed ever since Tom had been found guilty of running after
the peacock, with an illusory idea that fright would make one of its
feathers drop off."
1305,"But in that intense being lay the strength of reaction.
Through all his
bodily infirmity there ran a tenacious nerve of ambitious
self-preserving will, which had continually leaped out like a flame,
scattering all doctrinal fears, and which, even while he sat an object
of compassion for the merciful, was beginning to stir and glow under
his ashy paleness."
1306,"Then he moved his pork
nearer to the fire, and sat down to the agreeable business of tending
the meat and warming himself at the same time."
1307,"“Do you mean to say for certain, Mr. Trumbull, that my brother has left
his land away from our family?” said Mrs. Waule, on whom, as an
unhopeful woman, those long words had a depressing effect."
1308,"He got into a boat, and went down the river to a
favourite village, where he dined, and lingered till it was late enough
for him to return."
1309,"that
they fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea-breezes."
1310,"The exceptional fact of his presence was much noticed in
the room, where there was a good deal of Middlemarch company; and
several lookers-on, as well as some of the players, were betting with
animation."
1311,"I don’t mean with the
titled aristocracy.
I see very little good in people aiming out of
their own sphere."
1312,"She had set out at an early hour, but had lingered on the road,
inclined by her indolence to believe that if she waited under a warm
shed the snow would cease to fall."
1313,"Where, after all,
would be the use of his confessing the past to Nancy Lammeter, and
throwing away his happiness?—nay, hers?"
1314,"“Should you like
to speak as old Job does?”
“Yes,” said Ben, stoutly; “it’s funnier."
1315,"He was certainly much revived; he had recovered all his usual
power of work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and there
might still be twenty years of achievement before him, which would
justify the thirty years of preparation."
1316,"“There’s something I want to do before dinner.”
“There’s no time to play at anything before dinner,” said Tom, whose
imagination was impatient of any intermediate prospect."
1317,"I shall soon
be better.
Go and tell him.”
But the silence in her husband’s ear was never more to be broken."
1318,"I presume that you have a home
elsewhere and will be glad to return to it.”
“Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old friend,
Nick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young Nick when we
knew you meant to marry the old widow."
1319,"Something roused Stephen too, and getting up from his
hard bed, he came to sit beside her."
1320,"In very tender years, when he still wore a lace border
under his outdoor cap, he was often observed peeping through the bars
of a gate and making minatory gestures with his small forefinger while
he scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr, intended to strike
terror into their astonished minds; indicating thus early that desire
for mastery over the inferior animals, wild and domestic, including
cockchafers, neighbours’ dogs, and small sisters, which in all ages has
been an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race."
1321,"It was too early yet for her fully to recognize or at least
admit the change, still more for her to have readjusted that
devotedness which was so necessary a part of her mental life that she
was almost sure sooner or later to recover it."
1322,"Will you ask her
if she can see me—see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few minutes?”
When the servant had gone to deliver that message, Dorothea could hear
sounds of music through an open window—a few notes from a man’s voice
and then a piano bursting into roulades."
1323,"See if you are not
burnt in effigy this 5th of November coming.
Humphrey would not come to
quarrel with you about it, so I am come.”
“Very good."
1324,"He had seen Miss Vincy above his horizon
almost as long as it had taken Mr. Casaubon to become engaged and
married: but this learned gentleman was possessed of a fortune; he had
assembled his voluminous notes, and had made that sort of reputation
which precedes performance,—often the larger part of a man’s fame."
1325,"“I will not offend again.
I
will not even refer to Dido or Zenobia."
1326,"He passed his
trembling hand all about the hole, trying to think it possible that his
eyes had deceived him; then he held the candle in the hole and examined
it curiously, trembling more and more."
1327,"Ladislaw has been invaluable, most satisfactory.
I
consider that I have done this part of the country a service by
bringing him—by bringing him, you know.” Mr. Brooke ended with a nod,
turning round to give it."
1328,"“Are you sure Mary is fond of
you, or would ever have you?”
“I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden me—I
didn’t know what else to do,” said Fred, apologetically."
1329,"“Pray, are Mr
Guest’s sisters giantesses?”
“Oh no; and not handsome,—that is, not very,” said Lucy, half-penitent
at this uncharitable remark."
1330,"They were looking at each other like two fond
children who were talking confidentially of birds."
1331,"“I
mean, in my truth to you.
When I thought you doubted of that, I didn’t
care about anything that was left."
1332,"it ’ud be a lovely life!”
Bob paused, and then said, with defiant decision, as if resolutely
turning his back on that paradisaic picture:
“But I don’t mind about it, not a chip!"
1333,"You _must_ come; Lucy told me to say so.”
“Oh, pooh!"
1334,"He gave a few puffs before he spat and replied, “And
they wouldn’t be fur wrong, John.”
After this feeble delusive thaw, the silence set in as severely as
before."
1335,"“Well,” said Lydgate in a guessing tone, “it would take at least a
thousand to set me at ease."
1336,"And
when gratitude has become a matter of reasoning there are many ways of
escaping from its bonds."
1337,"‘And a deal sooner I would,’
says Fletcher; ‘for what’s more against one’s stomach than a man coming
and making himself bad company with his religion, and giving out as the
Ten Commandments are not enough for him, and all the while he’s worse
than half the men at the tread-mill?’ Fletcher said so himself.”
“It’ll be a bad thing for the town though, if Bulstrode’s money goes
out of it,” said Mr. Limp, quaveringly."
1338,"“Ay, sir, you say true,” returned Bob, nodding his head aside; “I think
my head’s all alive inside like an old cheese, for I’m so full o’
plans, one knocks another over."
1339,"Nevertheless it was a very happy fortnight to Maggie, this visit to
Tom."
1340,"“Here you all are, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, shuffling round and shaking
hands."
1341,"Why, any upstart who has got neither blood nor position.
People
of standing should consume their independent nonsense at home, not hawk
it about."
1342,"“You’re forgetting that you’ve left
that dreary schoolroom behind you, and have no little girls’ clothes to
mend.”
“Yes,” said Maggie."
1343,"Frowning with a double amount of intention, if not of corrugation, he
(carefully) drew the sword from its sheath, and pointed it at Maggie."
1344,"“It is the most horrible of
virgin-sacrifices,” said Will; and he painted to himself what were
Dorothea’s inward sorrows as if he had been writing a choric wail."
1345,"All St Ogg’s, I fancy, would pronounce her to be more than
my equal.”
Wakem darted a glance of fierce question at his son; but Philip was not
looking at him, and with a certain penitent consciousness went on, in a
few moments, as if in amplification of his last words,—
“Find a single person in St Ogg’s who will not tell you that a
beautiful creature like her would be throwing herself away on a
pitiable object like me.”
“Not she!” said Wakem, rising again, and forgetting everything else in
a burst of resentful pride, half fatherly, half personal."
1346,"She felt
relieved that it was not the old man who seemed to be going with her,
but she had only a trembling hope that she was really going home."
1347,"How different he was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher!
Those
young men had not a notion of French, and could speak on no subject
with striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades,
which of course they were ashamed to mention; they were Middlemarch
gentry, elated with their silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but
embarrassed in their manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above
them, having at least the accent and manner of a university man."
1348,"But with a girl of that disposition!
To the
world’s wife there had always been something in Miss Tulliver’s very
_physique_ that a refined instinct felt to be prophetic of harm."
1349,"All was silent there; her father was lying, heedless of
everything around him, with his eyes closed as when she had left him."
1350,"And
then I should know what to do, when I got older: I should see how it
was possible to lead a grand life here—now—in England."
1351,"But she feared to say any word, and he went on immediately.
“It is impossible for me now to do anything—to take any step without
considering my wife’s happiness."
1352,"Her imagination had darted
backward in conjectures, and forward in previsions, of what this
revealed fatherhood implied; and there were words in Godfrey’s last
speech which helped to make the previsions especially definite."
1353,"“If I can only see my boy strong again,” she said, in her loving folly;
“and who knows?—perhaps master of Stone Court!"
1354,"And if you and aunt Pullet,” he
continued, looking at the latter, “think of leaving any money to me and
Maggie, wouldn’t it be better to give it now, and pay the debt we’re
going to be sold up for, and save my mother from parting with her
furniture?”
There was silence for a few moments, for every one, including Maggie,
was astonished at Tom’s sudden manliness of tone."
1355,"But I got Johnson
to be quiet, and I hushed the matter up."
1356,"Mary Garth seemed all the plainer
standing at an angle between the two nymphs—the one in the glass, and
the one out of it, who looked at each other with eyes of heavenly blue,
deep enough to hold the most exquisite meanings an ingenious beholder
could put into them, and deep enough to hide the meanings of the owner
if these should happen to be less exquisite."
1357,"It was all one flash to
Dorothea—his last words—his distant bow to her as he reached the
door—the sense that he was no longer there."
1358,"“Why, you don’t like that, you silly.
You may have it if it comes to
you fair, but I sha’n’t give it you without."
1359,"This Reform will touch everybody by-and-by—a
thoroughly popular measure—a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come
first before the rest can follow."
1360,"I was not quite so sure
that you would be the same; I know you are so clever, and you must have
seen and learnt so much to fill your mind; I was not quite sure you
would care about me now.”
“I have never had any doubt that you would be the same, whenever I
might see you,” said Philip,—“I mean, the same in everything that made
me like you better than any one else."
1361,"This way of establishing sequences is
too common to be fairly regarded as a peculiar folly in Rosamond."
1362,"I want
that sort of thing—not ideas, you know, but a way of putting them.”
“Pocket-boroughs would be a fine thing,” said Ladislaw, “if they were
always in the right pocket, and there were always a Burke at hand.”
Will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison, even from
Mr. Brooke; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be
conscious of expressing one’s self better than others and never to have
it noticed, and in the general dearth of admiration for the right
thing, even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather
fortifying."
1363,"Jem Rodney’s story was no more than what might have been expected
by anybody who had seen how Marner had cured Sally Oates, and made her
sleep like a baby, when her heart had been beating enough to burst her
body, for two months and more, while she had been under the doctor’s
care."
1364,"Nettle-seed needs no digging.
The ruin of this countryside by railroads
was discussed, not only at the “Weights and Scales,” but in the
hay-field, where the muster of working hands gave opportunities for
talk such as were rarely had through the rural year."
1365,"But Jane and Martha sank under the rush of questions, and
began to cry; poor Mrs. Cranch being half moved with the consolation of
getting any hundreds at all without working for them, and half aware
that her share was scanty; whereas Mrs. Waule’s mind was entirely
flooded with the sense of being an own sister and getting little, while
somebody else was to have much."
1366,"But the smile
disappeared as she went on meditating, and at last she said aloud—
“Oh, it was cruel to speak so!"
1367,"“When did I rejoice
or triumph over you?”
“There’s ways o’ doing things worse than speaking out plain, Mr Glegg."
1368,"“Wouldn’t a parson be almost too high-learnt to bring up a lad
to be a man o’ business?"
1369,"For in truth, as the day fixed
for his marriage came nearer, Mr. Casaubon did not find his spirits
rising; nor did the contemplation of that matrimonial garden scene,
where, as all experience showed, the path was to be bordered with
flowers, prove persistently more enchanting to him than the accustomed
vaults where he walked taper in hand."
1370,"“Heyday, miss!” he said at last, “you have a fine color."
1371,"“That is easily said, Chettam, easily said, you know.”
“My dear sir,” persisted Sir James, restraining his indignation within
respectful forms, “it was you who brought him here, and you who keep
him here—I mean by the occupation you give him.”
“Yes, but I can’t dismiss him in an instant without assigning reasons,
my dear Chettam."
1372,"Tom, some weeks ago, had sent her word
that Philip knew no end of stories,—not stupid stories like hers; and
she was convinced now from her own observation that he must be very
clever; she hoped he would think _her_ rather clever too, when she came
to talk to him."
1373,"Who would know where his money was hidden?
_Who would
know that anybody had come to take it away?_ He went no farther into
the subtleties of evidence: the pressing question, “Where _is_ the
money?” now took such entire possession of him as to make him quite
forget that the weaver’s death was not a certainty."
1374,"It was easy for
her to fill her mornings apart from Lucy without any obvious effort;
for she had her promised visits to pay to her aunt Glegg, and it was
natural that she should give her mother more than usual of her
companionship in these last weeks, especially as there were
preparations to be thought of for Tom’s housekeeping."
1375,"The thought that she herself might be what Will most
cared for did throb through her an instant, but then came doubt: the
memory of the little they had lived through together turned pale and
shrank before the memory which suggested how much fuller might have
been the intercourse between Will and some one else with whom he had
had constant companionship."
1376,"We get a deal o’ useless
things about us, only because we’ve got the money to spend.”
“Mr Glegg,” said Mrs G., “if you’ll be kind enough to let me speak,
i’stead o’ taking the words out o’ my mouth,—I was going to say, Bessy,
as it’s fine talking for you to say as you’ve never asked us to buy
anything for you; let me tell you, you _ought_ to have asked us."
1377,"The livelong day he sat in his loom, his ear filled
with its monotony, his eyes bent close down on the slow growth of
sameness in the brownish web, his muscles moving with such even
repetition that their pause seemed almost as much a constraint as the
holding of his breath."
1378,"“My mother is like old George the Third,” said the Vicar, “she objects
to metaphysics.”
“I object to what is wrong, Camden."
1379,"At Philip’s name she had
blushed, and the blush deepened every instant from consciousness, until
the mention of the Red Deeps made her feel as if the whole secret were
betrayed, and she dared not even hold her tea-spoon lest she should
show how she trembled."
1380,"“I could sit up with you
to-night, and Jane with me, willingly, and you might take your own time
to speak, or let me speak.”
“Yes, I shall take my own time—you needn’t offer me yours,” said Peter."
1381,"Ben and Letty Garth, who were uncle and aunt before they were well in
their teens, disputed much as to whether nephews or nieces were more
desirable; Ben contending that it was clear girls were good for less
than boys, else they would not be always in petticoats, which showed
how little they were meant for; whereupon Letty, who argued much from
books, got angry in replying that God made coats of skins for both Adam
and Eve alike—also it occurred to her that in the East the men too wore
petticoats."
1382,"As I look
at the full stream, the vivid grass, the delicate bright-green powder
softening the outline of the great trunks and branches that gleam from
under the bare purple boughs, I am in love with moistness, and envy the
white ducks that are dipping their heads far into the water here among
the withes, unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier
world above."
1383,"The story can be told without
many words.
It happened when he was studying in Paris, and just at the
time when, over and above his other work, he was occupied with some
galvanic experiments."
1384,"But instead of saying anything more to him, his father
continued to look with a growing distinctness of suspicion at Mr Glegg
and the deeds."
1385,"Still more, to see people who have
been only insignificantly offensive to us reduced in life and
humiliated, without any special effort of ours, is apt to have a
soothing, flattering influence."
1386,"“It will only haunt
me.
Let us walk, Philip.
I must go home.”
She moved away, so that he was obliged to rise and follow her."
1387,"Things may be bad for the poor man—bad they are; but I
want the lads here not to do what will make things worse for
themselves."
1388,"But she
would write another to-morrow and invite him.
“I’ll call and beat him up to-morrow,” said Stephen, “and bring him
with me in the evening, shall I?"
1389,"He is preparing a new ward in case of the cholera coming
to us.”
“And preparing theories of treatment to try on the patients, I
suppose,” said Mr. Toller."
1390,"Her most
cheerful supposition was that her aunt Bulstrode had interfered in some
way to hinder Lydgate’s visits: everything was better than a
spontaneous indifference in him."
1391,"If he went on in
that way, he would lose Miss Nancy Lammeter; for it was well known that
she had looked very shyly on him ever since last Whitsuntide
twelvemonth, when there was so much talk about his being away from home
days and days together."
1392,"She couldn’t come back then; no one would have spoken to her;
and how very well that maize-coloured satinette becomes her complexion!"
1393,"In the beginning of
dinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the
mass of a magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably."
1394,"dared to ask for pay except as a
charge on drugs.
But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to foresee
that his new course would be even more offensive to the laity; and to
Mr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though not one
of his patients, questioned him in an affable manner on the subject, he
was injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of his
reasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the character
of practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if their only
mode of getting paid for their work was by their making out long bills
for draughts, boluses, and mixtures."
1395,"“Sister, for goodness’ sake let ’em put the horse in the carriage and
take me home; we shall perhaps find her on the road."
1396,"For himself he only wanted a
useful hack, which would draw upon occasion; being about to marry and
to give up hunting."
1397,"They implied
that he was insolent, pretentious, and given to that reckless
innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the
charlatan."
1398,"“You are
not impartial, and _I_ think any barrel-organ splendid.”
“But tell me what you think of him, now."
1399,"He thought it was becoming a sort of monomania with him, to want
that long look from Maggie; and he was racking his invention
continually to find out some means by which he could have it without
its appearing singular and entailing subsequent embarrassment."
1400,"That is
my opinion, and I am ready to maintain it against any one who
contradicts me.” Mr. Wrench’s voice had become exceedingly sharp."
1401,"“Well, Tulliver, we’re glad to see you again,” said Mr Stelling,
heartily."
1402,"All is purity and
order in this once dreary room, for, fifteen years ago, it was entered
by a new presiding spirit."
1403,"“I’ll pitch this can at your
eye if you talk o’ _my_ stealing your money.”
“Come, come, Master Marner,” said the landlord, now rising resolutely,
and seizing Marner by the shoulder, “if you’ve got any information to
lay, speak it out sensible, and show as you’re in your right mind, if
you expect anybody to listen to you."
1404,"For Rosamond never showed any
unbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct
sentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private
album for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the
irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date."
1405,"I thought you’d come
round.
I’m the fellow to bring old Bryce up to the scratch."
1406,"But Mr Turnbull came now to meet her; a medical man is the good angel
of the troubled house, and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom
she remembered as long as she could remember anything, with a
trembling, questioning look."
1407,"But where’s the use o’ talking?—you
can’t think what goes on in a ’cute man’s inside.”
“But you held in for all that, didn’t you, Mr. Macey?” said the
landlord."
1408,"When he
had something painful to tell, it was usually his way to introduce it
among a number of disjointed particulars, as if it were a medicine that
would get a milder flavor by mixing."
1409,"But he recalled
himself.
“You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope.”
“I will let you hear my attempts, if you like,” said Rosamond."
1410,"But I could hardly make
out whether it was James that you thought wrong, or Mrs. Cadwallader.”
“Neither,” said Dorothea."
1411,"Maggie had an awe of
him, against which she struggled as something unfair to her
consciousness of wider thoughts and deeper motives; but it was of no
use to struggle."
1412,"What an artful creature she was!
What a
_mother_ for those children!
It was enough to make poor Mrs Kenn turn
in her grave, that they should be put under the care of this girl only
a few weeks after her death."
1413,"Stephen’s passionate words made the
vision of such a life more fully present to her than it had ever been
before; and the vision for the time excluded all realities,—all except
the returning sun-gleams which broke out on the waters as the evening
approached, and mingled with the visionary sunlight of promised
happiness; all except the hand that pressed hers, and the voice that
spoke to her, and the eyes that looked at her with grave, unspeakable
love."
1414,"“Does it hurt you to hear the name mentioned, Maggie?
If it does, I
will not speak of him again."
1415,"That respectable miller and maltster had left Tom behind, and driven
homeward in a state of great mental satisfaction."
1416,"You will
like to know that your husband has warm friends, who have not left off
believing in his high character?"
1417,"She was usually
spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her
sister Celia had more common-sense."
1418,"He perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of the
sudden relief from debt, and he himself was careful to glide away from
all approaches towards the subject."
1419,"“Well, then,” said Wakem, rather brutally, trying to recover his
previous position, “if she doesn’t care for you, you might have spared
yourself the trouble of talking to me about her, and you might have
spared me the trouble of refusing my consent to what was never likely
to happen.”
Wakem strode to the door, and without looking round again, banged it
after him."
1420,"Having made his clerical
toilet with due care in the morning, he was prepared only for those
amenities of life which were suited to the well-adjusted stiff cravat
of the period, and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter."
1421,"“He’s not a man we can take into the family.
At least, I
must speak for myself,” he continued, carefully keeping his eyes off
Mr. Brooke."
1422,"The tables were now turned
on that dear brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of
his cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of
delight to Solomon."
1423,"“At first, I’d a sort o’ feeling come across me now and then,” he was
saying in a subdued tone, “as if you might be changed into the gold
again; for sometimes, turn my head which way I would, I seemed to see
the gold; and I thought I should be glad if I could feel it, and find
it was come back."
1424,"The flush deepened when she
saw Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey Cass.
She made her little rustic curtsy, and
held the door wide for them to enter."
1425,"It was impossible to
help fleeting visions of another kind—new dignities and an acknowledged
value of which she had often felt the absence."
1426,"There were plenty of dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty
business; and Will protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr.
Brooke through would be quite innocent."
1427,"“I could ha’ wished Nancy had had the luck to find a child like that
and bring her up,” said Priscilla to her father, as they sat in the
gig; “I should ha’ had something young to think of then, besides the
lambs and the calves.”
“Yes, my dear, yes,” said Mr. Lammeter; “one feels that as one gets
older."
1428,"Though there isn’t many sorts o’ goods as I
can’t over-praise when I set my tongue to’t.”
Mrs Bob’s small nose seemed to be following the example of her eyes in
turning up reverentially toward Maggie, but she was able now to smile
and curtsey, and say, “I’d looked forrard like aenything to seein’ you,
Miss, for my husband’s tongue’s been runnin’ on you, like as if he was
light-headed, iver since first he come a-courtin’ on me.”
“Well, well,” said Bob, looking rather silly."
1429,"“Maggie, Maggie!” exclaimed Mrs Tulliver, sitting stout and helpless
with the brushes on her lap, “what is to become of you if you’re so
naughty?"
1430,"I never moped: but I
can see that Casaubon does, you know."
1431,"“I’ve sometimes thought there’s a loop too much o’ ribbon on this left
side, sister; what do you think?” said Mrs Pullet."
1432,"_I_ aren’t a turn-tail cur.”
“Aye, but there’s this in it, Dowlas,” said the landlord, speaking in a
tone of much candour and tolerance."
1433,"But
he had something else to curse—his own vicious folly, which now seemed
as mad and unaccountable to him as almost all our follies and vices do
when their promptings have long passed away."
1434,"At least this
was the effect on Lucy; and you will not, I hope, consider it an
indication of vanity predominating over more tender impulses, that she
just glanced in the chimney-glass as her walk brought her near it."
1435,"And now your father has no ready money to spare, and
your mother will have to pay away her ninety-two pounds that she has
saved, and she says your savings must go too."
1436,"Then Mrs Glegg felt that she had adequate fighting-ground; then
she laid aside Baxter, and was ready to meet all comers."
1437,"I’m
for peace and quietness, I am.”
“Yes, that’s what every yapping cur is, when you hold a stick up at
him,” said the farrier."
1438,"That is why I want her
to come to me now, and have a long, long holiday.”
“Very sweet and angelic of you,” said Stephen, looking at her with an
admiring smile; “and all the more so if she has the conversational
qualities of her mother.”
“Poor aunty!"
1439,"We must be away a week or so.”
“Oh, more than that!” said Rosamond, earnestly."
1440,"I shall be very happy
when I hear that you have made your value felt."
1441,"What has happened?
What has he done with my
horse?”
“Ah, I thought it was yours, though he pretended you had parted with it
to him.”
“Has he thrown him down and broken his knees?” said Godfrey, flushed
with exasperation."
1442,"He was
rather impatient under that open ardent good-will, which he saw was her
usual state of feeling."
1443,"He was
winning, but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers
should end, and Lydgate at last took his leave."
1444,"Since these were the consequences
of going to law, his father was really blamable, as his aunts and
uncles had always said he was; and it was a significant indication of
Tom’s character, that though he thought his aunts ought to do something
more for his mother, he felt nothing like Maggie’s violent resentment
against them for showing no eager tenderness and generosity."
1445,"An’ I wull speak, too.
I’ll hev my
say—supper or no."
1446,"Hadn’t she
wanted to give him the money, and said how very sorry she was?"
1447,"He’s done nobody any harm but himself and his family,—the more’s
the pity,—and I go and look at the bare shelves every day, and think
where all my things used to stand.”
“Yes, yes, I’ll bear it in mind,” said Mr Wakem, hastily, looking
toward the open door."
1448,"Now that Peter Featherstone
was up-stairs, his property could be discussed with all that local
enlightenment to be found on the spot: some rural and Middlemarch
neighbors expressed much agreement with the family and sympathy with
their interest against the Vincys, and feminine visitors were even
moved to tears, in conversation with Mrs. Waule, when they recalled the
fact that they themselves had been disappointed in times past by
codicils and marriages for spite on the part of ungrateful elderly
gentlemen, who, it might have been supposed, had been spared for
something better."
1449,"But Mary had felt sure that her
parents would want to see her, and if her father had not come, she
would have obtained leave to go home for an hour or two the next day."
1450,"The
Squire’s short o’ cash, and in no humour to stand any nonsense; and you
know what he threatened, if ever he found you making away with his
money again."
1451,"Sitting alone in that
library at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather; you must
get a few people round you who wouldn’t believe you if you told them."
1452,"Flirtation, after all, was not
necessarily a singeing process.
Rosamond, for her part, had never
enjoyed the days so much in her life before: she was sure of being
admired by some one worth captivating, and she did not distinguish
flirtation from love, either in herself or in another."
1453,"Big checks and
live things, like stags and foxes, all her table-linen is,—not a spot
nor a diamond among ’em."
1454,"“Not a sad while, father—I mean to be merry,” said Mary, laughingly."
1455,"Years before, the only
daughter had run away, defied her parents, and gone on the stage; and
now the only boy died, and after a short time Mr. Dunkirk died also."
1456,"“Oh, Tom!” she burst out, clasping her hands, “where are the books?"
1457,"She turned from the window with gladness in
her eyes, for the wife’s chief dread was stilled."
1458,"He held himself to be, with some private scholarly
reservations, a believing Christian, as to estimates of the present and
hopes of the future."
1459,"At length the “Supper at Emmaus” was brought forward, to Will’s immense
relief, for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had
drawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall just
behind the auctioneer."
1460,"But I
wish you’d go with me too.” She thought anything was better than going
with one of the dreadful men alone; it would be more cheerful to be
murdered by a larger party."
1461,"And here you have been so happy going all about Tipton with
Mr. Garth into the worst backyards."
1462,"Come, dear,
put down that work and come to me.”
He was really in chill gloom about her at that moment, but he dreaded a
future without affection, and was determined to resist the oncoming of
division between them."
1463,"“My address is on my card.
But if you will allow me I
will call again to-morrow at an hour when Mr. Casaubon is likely to be
at home.”
“He goes to read in the Library of the Vatican every day, and you can
hardly see him except by an appointment."
1464,"The sand and bricks looked as if they had not been
moved.
_Was_ it a thief who had taken the bags?"
1465,"Rosamond in a poor lodging, though
in the largest city or most distant town, would not find the life that
could save her from gloom, and save him from the reproach of having
plunged her into it."
1466,"But if Maggie had been
the queen of coquettes she could hardly have invented a means of giving
greater piquancy to her beauty in Stephen’s eyes; I am not sure that
the quiet admission of plain sewing and poverty would have done alone,
but assisted by the beauty, they made Maggie more unlike other women
even than she had seemed at first."
1467,"I take the world as I
find it, in trade and everything else."
1468,"I am not aware that Mary knows anything
of the matter.”
But she hesitated to beg that he would keep entire silence on a subject
which she had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being used to stoop
in that way; and while she was hesitating there was already a rush of
unintended consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things
stood."
1469,"“O God, if my life is to be long,
let me live to bless and comfort——”
At that moment Maggie felt a startling sensation of sudden cold about
her knees and feet; it was water flowing under her."
1470,"At one time you take pleasure in a sort of perverse self-denial, and at
another you have not resolution to resist a thing that you know to be
wrong.”
There was a terrible cutting truth in Tom’s words,—that hard rind of
truth which is discerned by unimaginative, unsympathetic minds."
1471,"She was not
fond of visiting that house, but she liked, as she said, to see
collections of strange animals such as there would be at this funeral;
and she had persuaded Sir James and the young Lady Chettam to drive the
Rector and herself to Lowick in order that the visit might be
altogether pleasant."
1472,"The truth flashed on Tom’s mind in an instant.
To “have the bailiff in
the house,” and “to be sold up,” were phrases which he had been used
to, even as a little boy; they were part of the disgrace and misery of
“failing,” of losing all one’s money, and being ruined,—sinking into
the condition of poor working people."
1473,"What do you say now, Prissy?”—here Bob turned to his wife,—“Isn’t
it all come true as I said?"
1474,"I told you not to come in without
going to Martha first, you know I did.”
“Tom come out with me,” whispered Maggie, pulling his sleeve as she
passed him; and Tom followed willingly enough."
1475,"That is the
plain fact of the case.
But let us dismiss it."
1476,"“Ah, I see it’s not the same woman I saw,” he said, as he came up."
1477,"Society never made the preposterous demand that a
man should think as much about his own qualifications for making a
charming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy."
1478,"Even people whose lives have been made various by learning, sometimes
find it hard to keep a fast hold on their habitual views of life, on
their faith in the Invisible, nay, on the sense that their past joys
and sorrows are a real experience, when they are suddenly transported
to a new land, where the beings around them know nothing of their
history, and share none of their ideas—where their mother earth shows
another lap, and human life has other forms than those on which their
souls have been nourished."
1479,"But the immediate presence of this
disgrace was so much keener an experience to Tom than the worst form of
apprehension, that he felt at this moment as if his real trouble had
only just begun: it was a touch on the irritated nerve compared with
its spontaneous dull aching."
1480,"He was one of those
rare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to others."
1481,"Will you please to carry it in your
pocket?”
“Ay, ay,” said Mr Tulliver, putting it carefully in his side pocket."
1482,"It was part of Rosamond’s cleverness to
discern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank, and once when she had
seen the Miss Brookes accompanying their uncle at the county assizes,
and seated among the aristocracy, she had envied them, notwithstanding
their plain dress."
1483,"He would make a good secretary, now, like Hobbes, Milton,
Swift—that sort of man.”
“I understand,” said Mrs. Cadwallader."
1484,"The creditor
was Mr. Bambridge, a horse-dealer of the neighborhood, whose company
was much sought in Middlemarch by young men understood to be “addicted
to pleasure.” During the vacations Fred had naturally required more
amusements than he had ready money for, and Mr. Bambridge had been
accommodating enough not only to trust him for the hire of horses and
the accidental expense of ruining a fine hunter, but also to make a
small advance by which he might be able to meet some losses at
billiards."
1485,"One change terrified her as if it had
been a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed
husband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything she
said and did."
1486,"“Mrs Tulliver, I think?” said Mr Wakem.
“Yes, sir; Miss Elizabeth Dodson as was.”
“Pray be seated."
1487,"That quiet mutual gaze of
a trusting husband and wife is like the first moment of rest or refuge
from a great weariness or a great danger—not to be interfered with by
speech or action which would distract the sensations from the fresh
enjoyment of repose."
1488,"Ladislaw had made up his mind that
she must be an unpleasant girl, since she was going to marry Casaubon,
and what she said of her stupidity about pictures would have confirmed
that opinion even if he had believed her."
1489,"Silas had
seated himself in his loom, and the noise of weaving had begun; but he
had left his scissors on a ledge which Eppie’s arm was long enough to
reach; and now, like a small mouse, watching her opportunity, she stole
quietly from her corner, secured the scissors, and toddled to the bed
again, setting up her back as a mode of concealing the fact."
1490,"The suffering, whether of martyr or victim, which belongs to
every historical advance of mankind, is represented in this way in
every town, and by hundreds of obscure hearths; and we need not shrink
from this comparison of small things with great; for does not science
tell us that its highest striving is after the ascertainment of a unity
which shall bind the smallest things with the greatest?"
1491,"“My love,” he said, with irritation reined in by propriety, “you may
rely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to the
different stages of a work which is not to be measured by the facile
conjectures of ignorant onlookers."
1492,"I don’t own you any more than if I saw a
crow; and if you want to own me you’ll get nothing by it but a
character for being what you are—a spiteful, brassy, bullying rogue.”
“That’s a pity, now, Josh,” said Raffles, affecting to scratch his head
and wrinkle his brows upward as if he were nonplussed."
1493,"I have
neither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate.”
Here Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if he would return to his
writing, though his hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be
written in an unknown character."
1494,"And you’d got to be very
good once; I can’t think how it’s turned out the wrong way so!”
Still two or three more days passed, and Maggie heard nothing of
Philip; anxiety about him was becoming her predominant trouble, and she
summoned courage at last to inquire about him of Dr Kenn, on his next
visit to her."
1495,"When Maggie spoke, it was hardly above a whisper.
“And—and—poor father——”
Maggie could not utter it."
1496,"She was in her brighter aerial world again, when a
little tap came at the door; of course it was her cousin, who entered
in ample white dressing-gown."
1497,"She knew at once that her brother was not in a good humour;
he never called her Mrs Moss except when he was angry, and when they
were in company."
1498,"The perception that she was ill threw every other
thought into the background.
When he felt her pulse, her eyes rested on
him with more persistence than they had done for a long while, as if
she felt some content that he was there."
1499,"“We are forever divided,” said Will.
“I might as well be at Rome; she
would be no farther from me.” But what we call our despair is often
only the painful eagerness of unfed hope."
1500,"But the door opened and Rosamond re-entered.
She carried the leather
box containing the amethysts, and a tiny ornamental basket which
contained other boxes, and laying them on the chair where she had been
sitting, she said, with perfect propriety in her air—
“This is all the jewellery you ever gave me."
1501,"I should so like to see the old spot and everything you
were used to."
1502,"I’ll show him something different from his bows
and arrows,” said Mr Poulter, coughing and drawing himself up, while he
gave a little preliminary play to his wrist."
1503,"But there’s
none of ’em got better chany, not even your aunt Pullet herself; and I
bought it wi’ my own money as I’d saved ever since I was turned
fifteen; and the silver teapot, too,—your father never paid for ’em."
1504,"A boiled joint, as you could make broth of for the kitchen,”
Mrs Glegg added, in a tone of emphatic protest, “and a plain pudding,
with a spoonful o’ sugar, and no spice, ’ud be far more becoming.”
With sister Glegg in this humour, there was a cheerful prospect for the
day."
1505,"Mr. Casaubon was touched with an
unknown delight (what man would not have been?)"
1506,"When he entered
she was looking at some cameos which she had been buying for Celia."
1507,"The sharp little
woman’s conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these
opposing “bests,” and of her griefs and satisfactions under late
events, which were likely to humble those who needed humbling, but also
to fall heavily on her old friend whose faults she would have preferred
seeing on a background of prosperity."
1508,"Miss Vincy was alone, and blushed so deeply when Lydgate came in that
he felt a corresponding embarrassment, and instead of any playfulness,
he began at once to speak of his reason for calling, and to beg her,
almost formally, to deliver the message to her father."
1509,"“No,” said Maggie, “I’m only thinking that if she isn’t a very good
queen you might be glad when she died, and you could choose another."
1510,"“I said to Humphrey long ago, Mr. Brooke is going to make a
splash in the mud."
1511,"It is lawful to
marry again, I suppose; else we might as well be Hindoos instead of
Christians."
1512,"“We don’t want everybody,” said Miss Winifred.
“But _you_ would like
Miss Garth, mother, shouldn’t you?”
“My son’s choice shall be mine,” said Mrs. Farebrother, with majestic
discretion, “and a wife would be most welcome, Camden."
1513,"“How strange and unreal the trees and flowers look with the lights
among them!” said Maggie, in a low voice."
1514,"On this ground they
were both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr.
Minchin had never been in open hostility with him, and never differed
from him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode, who had found
that Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution."
1515,"He stood
looking at nothing in particular, with the blushing, awkward air and
semi-smile which are common to shy boys when in company,—very much as
if they had come into the world by mistake, and found it in a degree of
undress that was quite embarrassing."
1516,"“The child may not turn out ill with the weaver.
But, then, he
didn’t go to seek her, as we should be doing."
1517,"“Oh, what a nice little lady!—and rich, I’m sure,” said the old woman."
1518,"I feel somehow as sure as
I do when I’ve laid something up though I can’t justly put my hand on
it, as there was a rights in what happened to you, if one could but
make it out; and you’d no call to lose heart as you did."
1519,"Mary could
easily avoid looking upward.
“I do care about your mother’s money going,” he said, when she was
seated again and sewing quickly."
1520,"“Lucy,” Maggie began again, “_he_ struggled too.
He wanted to be true
to you."
1521,"She thought of her
father as she ran along, but she reconciled herself to the idea of
parting with him, by determining that she would secretly send him a
letter by a small gypsy, who would run away without telling where she
was, and just let him know that she was well and happy, and always
loved him very much."
1522,"Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures, and there was the
better hope of him because his scientific interest soon took the form
of a professional enthusiasm: he had a youthful belief in his
bread-winning work, not to be stifled by that initiation in makeshift
called his ’prentice days; and he carried to his studies in London,
Edinburgh, and Paris, the conviction that the medical profession as it
might be was the finest in the world; presenting the most perfect
interchange between science and art; offering the most direct alliance
between intellectual conquest and the social good."
1523,"“I must pull up.
Poor
Casaubon was a warning, you know."
1524,"The feeling of a few short weeks had hurried her into the sins her
nature had most recoiled from,—breach of faith and cruel selfishness;
she had rent the ties that had given meaning to duty, and had made
herself an outlawed soul, with no guide but the wayward choice of her
own passion."
1525,"The deepening expression of pain
on Philip’s face gave him a stronger resemblance to his boyish self,
and made the deformity appeal more strongly to her pity."
1526,"He was a remarkable fellow—I always
said he was a remarkable fellow.”
“Yes,” said Sir James, unable to repress a retort, “it is rather a pity
you formed that high opinion of him."
1527,"James would have taken any trouble
for you, and you might have gone on all your life doing what you
liked.”
“On the contrary, dear,” said Dorothea, “I never could do anything that
I liked."
1528,"There was still science—there were still good objects to
work for.
He must give a tug still—all the stronger because other
satisfactions were going."
1529,"But her instinctive dignity and
repugnance to any show of emotion made her sit perfectly still, and
only throw a little more decision into her voice, as she said—
“No, indeed, Mr. Godfrey, that’s not known to me, and I have very good
reasons for thinking different."
1530,"It was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode, with a cold
peremptoriness of manner which he had not before shown, said, “I came
to call you thus early, Mr. Raffles, because I have ordered the
carriage to be ready at half-past seven, and intend myself to conduct
you as far as Ilsely, where you can either take the railway or await a
coach.” Raffles was about to speak, but Bulstrode anticipated him
imperiously with the words, “Be silent, sir, and hear what I have to
say."
1531,"If he had to blame any one, it was necessary
for him to move all the papers within his reach, or describe various
diagrams with his stick, or make calculations with the odd money in his
pocket, before he could begin; and he would rather do other men’s work
than find fault with their doing."
1532,"“You don’t seem inclined for boating,” said Lucy, when he came to sit
down by her on the bench."
1533,"“Did you ever hear the like?” said Mrs. Kimble, laughing above her
double chin with much good-humour, aside to Mrs. Crackenthorp, who
blinked and nodded, and seemed to intend a smile, which, by the
correlation of forces, went off in small twitchings and noises."
1534,"It went the round of the country, that joke did.
But, what the hell!"
1535,"“They all try to blacken him before me; but
I will care for no pain, if he is not to blame."
1536,"I’m here upo’ Mr Tom’s
business, an’ I’m not the man to take up the time wi’ my own.”
“And pray, what _is_ this business as is to be kept from me?” said Mrs
Glegg, who, solicited by a double curiosity, was obliged to let the
one-half wait."
1537,"It would be
dishonorable to let others engage themselves to anything serious in
dependence on me."
1538,"From such
contentment poor Dorothea was shut out.
The intensity of her religious
disposition, the coercion it exercised over her life, was but one
aspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic, and intellectually
consequent: and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow
teaching, hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a
labyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no
whither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration
and inconsistency."
1539,"In old-fashioned times an “independence” was hardly ever made
without a little miserliness as a condition, and you would have found
that quality in every provincial district, combined with characters as
various as the fruits from which we can extract acid."
1540,"She thinks so much about everything, and is so
particular about what one says."
1541,"Mr Tulliver gave his horse a little stroke on the flank, then checked
it, and said angrily, “Stand still with you!” much to the astonishment
of that innocent animal."
1542,"It’s a poor tale, with all the law as there is up and down, if
it’s no use proving whose child you are."
1543,"Mary was just now at home
waiting for a situation, while Christy, the boy next to her, was
getting cheap learning and cheap fare in Scotland, having to his
father’s disappointment taken to books instead of that sacred calling
“business.”
The letters had come—nine costly letters, for which the postman had
been paid three and twopence, and Mr. Garth was forgetting his tea and
toast while he read his letters and laid them open one above the other,
sometimes swaying his head slowly, sometimes screwing up his mouth in
inward debate, but not forgetting to cut off a large red seal unbroken,
which Letty snatched up like an eager terrier."
1544,"There were
subjects, you perceive, on which Tom was much quicker than on the
niceties of classical construction, or the relations of a mathematical
demonstration."
1545,"It would be a graceful, easy way
of piecing on the new habits to the old, to have a few playful words
with Rosamond about his resistance to dissipation, and his firm resolve
to take long fasts even from sweet sounds."
1546,"“That is a poor
reason for giving up a connection which I think I may say will be
mutually beneficial.”
“I would injure no man if I could help it,” said Caleb; “even if I
thought God winked at it."
1547,"Maggie listened, passing
from her startled wonderment to the yearning after that belief that the
tide was doing it all, that she might glide along with the swift,
silent stream, and not struggle any more."
1548,"“It is impossible that you should not see it all clearly enough—you who
see everything.”
“I only see that you are behaving very ill, Fred, in speaking so of Mr.
Farebrother after he has pleaded your cause in every way."
1549,"Mr Stephen Guest had
certainly not behaved well; but then, young men were liable to those
sudden infatuated attachments; and bad as it might seem in Mrs Stephen
Guest to admit the faintest advances from her cousin’s lover (indeed it
_had_ been said that she was actually engaged to young Wakem,—old Wakem
himself had mentioned it), still, she was very young,—“and a deformed
young man, you know!—and young Guest so very fascinating; and, they
say, he positively worships her (to be sure, that can’t last!"
1550,"But after a day or two Mrs Tulliver was gone to the Mill again for a
few hours to see to Tom’s household matters."
1551,"“You didn’t put your full address to this letter,” Raffles continued."
1552,"One hand was on her husband’s
arm, and with the other she clasped the hand of her father Silas."
1553,"Silas asked himself if he had been asleep, and looked at the
clock: it was already four in the morning."
1554,"I would not creep along the coast but steer
Out in mid-sea, by guidance of the stars."
1555,"I was hoping you would remain among your friends, who are all in
this neighbourhood, I believe.”
“Oh, _I must go_,” said Maggie, earnestly, looking at Dr Kenn with an
expression of reliance, as if she had told him her history in those
three words."
1556,"“You are too young—it is an anachronism for you to have such thoughts,”
said Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head habitual to
him."
1557,"She would never again expect anything
else.
But she did hear the library door open, and slowly the light
advanced up the staircase without noise from the footsteps on the
carpet."
1558,"Then he turned to Tom, and said in his old sharp way, “Where have they
put Gore’s letter?”
It was close at hand in a drawer, for he had often asked for it before."
1559,"I think I
should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of
music."
1560,"But the careless and the fearful were alike sleeping in their beds now.
There was hope that the rain would abate by the morrow; threatenings of
a worse kind, from sudden thaws after falls of snow, had often passed
off, in the experience of the younger ones; and at the very worst, the
banks would be sure to break lower down the river when the tide came in
with violence, and so the waters would be carried off, without causing
more than temporary inconvenience, and losses that would be felt only
by the poorer sort, whom charity would relieve."
1561,"But as to listening to what one lawyer says without asking another—I
wonder at a man o’ your cleverness, Mr. Dill."
1562,"“But I have nothing to say to you beyond this: tell me what has passed
between you and Philip Wakem."
1563,"You will really be doing a kindness.”
“I should like it very much, if I may,” said Mary."
1564,"“He may pass on to a worse
stage; but I should not wonder if he got better in a few days, by
adhering to the treatment I have prescribed."
1565,"As
if I were not grateful for _any_ love.
But—but I had never thought of
your being my lover."
1566,"In his student’s chambers, he had
prearranged his social action quite differently."
1567,"“I am going away
immediately, and I could not go without speaking to you again.”
“I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago—you
thought you were going then,” said Dorothea, her voice trembling a
little."
1568,"“You mean to make painting your profession?
Mr. Casaubon
will like to hear that you have chosen a profession.”
“No, oh no,” said Will, with some coldness."
1569,"He tapped his box, and looked
round with a triumphant laugh.
“Ah, she has a quick wit, my friend Priscilla has,” said the doctor,
choosing to attribute the epigram to a lady rather than allow a
brother-in-law that advantage over him."
1570,"So deeply inherent is it in this life
of ours that men have to suffer for each other’s sins, so inevitably
diffusive is human suffering, that even justice makes its victims, and
we can conceive no retribution that does not spread beyond its mark in
pulsations of unmerited pain."
1571,Yet she said what she meant to say; she looked firm as well as sad.
1572,"“A fine fever hospital in addition to the old
infirmary might be the nucleus of a medical school here, when once we
get our medical reforms; and what would do more for medical education
than the spread of such schools over the country?"
1573,"Lydgate was fuming a little, pushed his hair back with one hand, felt
curiously in his waistcoat-pocket with the other, and then stooped to
beckon the tiny black spaniel, which had the insight to decline his
hollow caresses."
1574,"Supper was his favourite meal, because it came
at his time of revelry, when his heart warmed over his gold; whenever
he had roast-meat, he always chose to have it for supper."
1575,"His
mind glancing back to Laure while he looked at Rosamond, he said
inwardly, “Would _she_ kill me because I wearied her?” and then, “It is
the way with all women.” But this power of generalizing which gives men
so much the superiority in mistake over the dumb animals, was
immediately thwarted by Lydgate’s memory of wondering impressions from
the behavior of another woman—from Dorothea’s looks and tones of
emotion about her husband when Lydgate began to attend him—from her
passionate cry to be taught what would best comfort that man for whose
sake it seemed as if she must quell every impulse in her except the
yearnings of faithfulness and compassion."
1576,"‘The
Shrubs,’—they may be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?—have cut the
London concern altogether—perhaps turned country squire—have a rural
mansion to invite me to."
1577,"He’ll begin with
flourishing about the Rights of Man and end with murdering a wench."
1578,"Yet sweet Nancy might have been expected to feel still more keenly the
denial of a blessing to which she had looked forward with all the
varied expectations and preparations, solemn and prettily trivial,
which fill the mind of a loving woman when she expects to become a
mother."
1579,"I
know _I_ should, when I was her age.”
“La, Jane,” said Mrs Pullet, “it ’ud do your beds good to have somebody
to sleep in ’em."
1580,"I’ve got a clear
feeling inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will
go with me, Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary,
poor child.”
Caleb, leaning back in his chair, looked with anxious appeal towards
his wife."
1581,"If they had been at home, settled at Lowick in
ordinary life among their neighbors, the clash would have been less
embarrassing: but on a wedding journey, the express object of which is
to isolate two people on the ground that they are all the world to each
other, the sense of disagreement is, to say the least, confounding and
stultifying."
1582,"She thought
Mr Riley would have a respect for her now; it had been evident that he
thought nothing of her before."
1583,"“Should be glad to do you a service, Mr. Ladislaw—by Jove, I should!"
1584,"Mrs. Hackbutt saw
her coming from an up-stairs window, and remembering her former alarm
lest she should meet Mrs. Bulstrode, felt almost bound in consistency
to send word that she was not at home; but against that, there was a
sudden strong desire within her for the excitement of an interview in
which she was quite determined not to make the slightest allusion to
what was in her mind."
1585,"“You remember that we are going to dine at papa’s,” said Rosamond,
wishing that he should turn and make a more thorough concession to her."
1586,"And a husband likes to be
master.”
“I know that I must expect trials, uncle."
1587,"“He was afraid of some betrayal in my
hearing: all he wanted was to bind me to him by a strong obligation:
that was why he passed on a sudden from hardness to liberality."
1588,"I should like to enter into some business where I
can get on,—a manly business, where I should have to look after things,
and get credit for what I did."
1589,"Has any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of
pre-matrimonial acquaintanceship?"
1590,"Come in, Tom; come in,” he added, stepping in at the
French window."
1591,"The Vicar was a first-rate
billiard-player, and though he did not frequent the Green Dragon, there
were reports that he had sometimes been there in the daytime and had
won money."
1592,"“Three” came more slowly, and with it the sword swung downward,
and Maggie gave a loud shriek."
1593,"He laid down the knife and fork with which he was
carving, and throwing himself back in his chair, said at last, with a
cool irony in his tone—
“May I ask when and why you did so?”
“When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house, I called to tell him
not to mention ours to them; and at the same time I told him not to let
the affair go on any further."
1594,"Celia’s marriage seemed more serious than it used to do.
“It was only three days ago,” said Celia."
1595,"Do you think any body ought to blame
me?”
“For going into the Church under the circumstances?"
1596,"Nature had inspired many
arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon’s favorite pupil, who by general consent
(Fred’s excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and
amiability."
1597,"“No, no; I’m only going to Mary a minute.”
Mary was in a grassy corner of the garden, where there was a swing
loftily hung between two pear-trees."
1598,"The first impression on seeing Will was one of
sunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing
expression."
1599,"But she presently came back walking with new courage a little way
behind her husband, who showed the brilliancy of his blue eyes and
regular white teeth in the doorway, bowing respectfully."
1600,"Mrs. Cadwallader’s eyes, diverted from the churchyard, saw a good deal
of dumb show which was not so intelligible to her as she could have
desired, and could not repress the question, “Who is Mr. Ladislaw?”
“A young relative of Mr. Casaubon’s,” said Sir James, promptly."
1601,"He would soon have been
up with the hounds again, when the fatal accident happened; and hence
he was between eager riders in advance, not troubling themselves about
what happened behind them, and far-off stragglers, who were as likely
as not to pass quite aloof from the line of road in which Wildfire had
fallen."
1602,"“Do you
think I’m a presumptuous fool?”
“Oh, Philip!” said Maggie, “how can you think I have such feelings?"
1603,"Dorothea knew of no one who thought as she did about life and
its best objects."
1604,"And perhaps here was an opportunity
indicated for making her mind more worthy of its highest service;
perhaps the noblest, completest devoutness could hardly exist without
some width of knowledge; _must_ she always live in this resigned
imprisonment?"
1605,"poor things!” in
reference, probably, to the double loss of preaching and coal."
1606,"There
was but one way of doing this; any of those low callings in which men
are obliged to do good work at a low price were forbidden to clergymen;
was it their fault if their only resource was to turn out very poor
work at a high price?"
1607,"At the end of half an hour or more
he called Mrs. Abel and told her that he found himself unfit for
further watching."
1608,"His love for Maggie was
stamped, even more than the rest of his experience, with the
exaggerated sense that he was an exception,—that she, that every one,
saw him in the light of an exception."
1609,"He would start for Houndsley horse-fair which was to be
held the next morning, and—simply sell his horse, bringing back the
money by coach?—Well, the horse would hardly fetch more than thirty
pounds, and there was no knowing what might happen; it would be folly
to balk himself of luck beforehand."
1610,"And without his distinctly
recognizing the impulse, there certainly was present in him the sense
that Celia would be there, and that he should pay her more attention
than he had done before."
1611,"Her whole heart was going out at
this moment in sympathy with Will’s indignation: she only wanted to
convince him that she had never done him injustice, and he seemed to
have turned away from her as if she too had been part of the unfriendly
world."
1612,"“Let her go, and the sooner the better; she won’t be trying to
domineer over _me_ again in a hurry.”
“Sister Pullet,” said Mrs Tulliver, helplessly, “do you think it ’ud be
any use for you to go after her and try to pacify her?”
“Better not, better not,” said Mr Deane."
1613,"“But,” she added, after a pause, “not himself—he fell off his
horse."
1614,"“But you wouldn’t have married me then, Nancy, if I’d told you,” said
Godfrey, urged, in the bitterness of his self-reproach, to prove to
himself that his conduct had not been utter folly."
1615,"He walked up and down, unconscious that he
was plunging ankle-deep in snow, unconscious of everything but
trembling suspense about what was going on in the cottage, and the
effect of each alternative on his future lot."
1616,"He made no display of
humility on the subject, but in his heart he felt rather ashamed that
his conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices
were free from."
1617,"Lydgate had just dismissed a poor patient, in whom he was much
interested, and he came forward to put out his hand—with an open
cheerfulness which surprised Mr. Farebrother."
1618,"One of those fits of yearning was on him
now, and it would have been strong enough to have persuaded him to
trust Wildfire to Dunstan rather than disappoint the yearning, even if
he had not had another reason for his disinclination towards the
morrow’s hunt."
1619,"Maggie’s heart had swelled at this action
and speech of Bob’s; she knew well enough that it was a way he had
chosen to show his sympathy and respect."
1620,"Oh, I hope I
should be able to get the people well housed in Lowick!"
1621,"He felt that it
was not for him to make the painful revelation.
“But what brought it on?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking directly at him
with her large dark eyes."
1622,"“But I dare
say he’s forgotten it.”
“Oh, well, I can do that, then,” said Tom, not with any epigrammatic
intention, but with serious satisfaction at the idea that, as far as
Latin was concerned, there was no hindrance to his resembling Sir John
Crake."
1623,"However, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode,
hardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become
the proprietor of Stone Court, and what Peter would say “if he were
worthy to know,” had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of
conversation to his disappointed relatives."
1624,"Tell her, her husband
wants liveliness, diversion: put her on amusing tactics.”
Without Mr. Brooke’s advice, Lydgate had determined on speaking to
Dorothea."
1625,"And then there are all your plans!
You never can have thought of that."
1626,"“You must sit by yourself, aunty,” said that contriving young lady,
“because I must sit by Tom; I’ve a great deal to say to him.”
In the eagerness of her affectionate anxiety for Maggie, Lucy could not
persuade herself to defer a conversation about her with Tom, who, she
thought, with such a cup of joy before him as this rapid fulfilment of
his wish about the Mill, must become pliant and flexible."
1627,"It had occurred to him
that he must not any longer defer his intention of matrimony, and he
had reflected that in taking a wife, a man of good position should
expect and carefully choose a blooming young lady—the younger the
better, because more educable and submissive—of a rank equal to his
own, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good
understanding."
1628,"“Mr Glegg,” said Mrs G., in a fatal tone, “if you’re going to let that
man and his dog in on my carpet, before my very face, be so good as to
let me know."
1629,"But it soon appeared that the
gentlemen’s dressing-gowns, which were among her commodities, were
objects of such general attention and inquiry, and excited so
troublesome a curiosity as to their lining and comparative merits,
together with a determination to test them by trying on, as to make her
post a very conspicuous one."
1630,"“Six weeks would be ample—say so, Rosamond,” insisted Lydgate,
releasing her hands to put his arm gently round her."
1631,"Her honest ostentatious nature
made the sharing of a merited dishonor as bitter as it could be to any
mortal."
1632,"It was very hard upon him that he should be put at this disadvantage in
life by his father’s want of prudence; but he was not going to complain
and to find fault with people because they did not make everything easy
for him."
1633,"Of this sequence to Bichat’s work, already
vibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was
enamoured; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of
living structure, and help to define men’s thought more accurately
after the true order."
1634,"Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she
had set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the
pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on
finishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted
in), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to
propose something, said—
“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we
looked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them?"
1635,"I hear that Mr. Lydgate
is both.”
“Oh, Mr. Lydgate!” said Mary, with an unmistakable lapse into
indifference."
1636,"“You sit down, all of you,” said Mr Tulliver, peremptorily."
1637,"“I read so much when I was a lad, that I suppose it
will last me all my life."
1638,"He once called her his basil plant;
and when she asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant
which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man’s brains."
1639,"She had not long
to wait before the punctual attorney entered, knitting his brow with an
examining glance at the stout blond woman who rose, curtsying
deferentially,—a tallish man, with an aquiline nose and abundant
iron-gray hair."
1640,"With this idea in her head, she resorted to her usual plan when she
wanted to tell or ask her father anything particular: she found a
reason for her aunt Tulliver to leave the dining-room after dinner, and
seated herself on a small stool at her father’s knee."
1641,"In old days there were angels who came and took men by the hand and led
them away from the city of destruction."
1642,"“Naughty, naughty Eppie,” he suddenly began, holding her on his knee,
and pointing to her muddy feet and clothes—“naughty to cut with the
scissors and run away."
1643,"Bulstrode, not
knowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted this new
nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true
confessions, and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not
told anything, since he had just told the man who took him up in his
gig and brought him to Stone Court."
1644,"Chapter V.
The Cloven Tree
Secrets are rarely betrayed or discovered according to any programme
our fear has sketched out."
1645,"Besides, there is a man’s character
beforehand to speak for him.”
“But, my dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling gently at
her ardor, “character is not cut in marble—it is not something solid
and unalterable."
1646,"And I call it a robbery: it was like giving him the land, to
promise it; and what is promising, if making everybody believe is not
promising?"
1647,"The more you want me to do a thing, the more reason I shall
have for never doing it."
1648,"That I have some claim to the exercise of a veto here,
would not, I believe, be denied by any reasonable person cognizant of
the relations between us: relations which, though thrown into the past
by your recent procedure, are not thereby annulled in their character
of determining antecedents."
1649,"He loved money,
but he also loved to spend it in gratifying his peculiar tastes, and
perhaps he loved it best of all as a means of making others feel his
power more or less uncomfortably."
1650,"The small boys wore
excellent corduroy, the girls went out as tidy servants, or did a
little straw-plaiting at home: no looms here, no Dissent; and though
the public disposition was rather towards laying by money than towards
spirituality, there was not much vice."
1651,"“Piacer e popone
Vuol la sua stagione.”
—_Italian Proverb_.
Mr. Casaubon, as might be expected, spent a great deal of his time at
the Grange in these weeks, and the hindrance which courtship occasioned
to the progress of his great work—the Key to all Mythologies—naturally
made him look forward the more eagerly to the happy termination of
courtship."
1652,"Regarding themselves as Middlemarch
institutions, they were ready to combine against all innovators, and
against non-professionals given to interference."
1653,"“I, for my part,
hail the advent of Mr. Lydgate.
I hope to find good reason for
confiding the new hospital to his management.”
“That is all very fine,” replied Mr. Standish, who was not fond of Mr.
Bulstrode; “if you like him to try experiments on your hospital
patients, and kill a few people for charity I have no objection."
1654,"But she was not indifferent to him _yet_, though—
The entrance of Priscilla, bustling forward and saying, “Dear heart
alive, child, let us look at this gown,” cut off Godfrey’s hopes of a
quarrel."
1655,"How he came
to fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to
himself on the morrow; but before dinner something in the state of the
country, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were cut,
the stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on the walls,
had seemed to warrant a little recklessness."
1656,"It ’ud
be a help to me wi’ these lawsuits, and arbitrations, and things."
1657,"“Have they sold me up, then?” he said more calmly, as if he were
possessed simply by the desire to know what had happened."
1658,"I can see that she admires
you almost as much as a man expects to be admired."
1659,"I’n been wi’ you
twenty year, an’ you can’t get twenty year wi’ whistlin’ for ’em, no
more nor you can make the trees grow: you mun wait till God A’mighty
sends ’em."
1660,"The opportunity came at Mr. Vincy’s, where, on New Year’s Day, there
was a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the
plea that he must not forsake his old friends on the first new year of
his being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar."
1661,"“Dorothea, my love, this is not the first occasion, but it were well
that it should be the last, on which you have assumed a judgment on
subjects beyond your scope."
1662,"The belief that he
repented his marriage, and suffered from it, only aggravated her
vindictiveness."
1663,"There ought to be plenty of eligible
matches invited to Freshitt and the Grange."
1664,"And now you will go
and be shut up in that stone prison at Lowick: you will be buried
alive."
1665,"Will Ladislaw’s smile was delightful, unless you were
angry with him beforehand: it was a gush of inward light illuminating
the transparent skin as well as the eyes, and playing about every curve
and line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm, and
banishing forever the traces of moodiness."
1666,"I don’t require that to bind me.”
“Do what _I_ require,” said Tom."
1667,"But she needed time to gather up her strength;
she needed to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and pride of her
life."
1668,"This resolution can be a ground of surprise only to those
who are unacquainted with that obscure religious life which has gone on
in the alleys of our towns."
1669,"But I am constrained to take a view of the case which gives the
preponderance to Mr. Farebrother’s claims."
1670,"And then, too, there was the
fresh smart of that disclosure about his mother’s family, which if
known would be an added reason why Dorothea’s friends should look down
upon him as utterly below her."
1671,"“I see
no reason why I shouldn’t make a few acquaintances hereabout."
1672,"“But it’s true there’s no
hurry; you’ve hit it there, Bessy.”
“It might be as well not to defer the arrangement too long,” said Mr
Riley, quietly, “for Stelling may have propositions from other parties,
and I know he would not take more than two or three boarders, if so
many."
1673,"Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble carried on her
arm a small basket, into which she diverted a bit of sugar, which she
had first dropped in her saucer as if by mistake; looking round
furtively afterwards, and reverting to her teacup with a small innocent
noise as of a tiny timid quadruped."
1674,"“You won’t be giving me away, father,” she had said before they went to
church; “you’ll only be taking Aaron to be a son to you.”
Dolly Winthrop walked behind with her husband; and there ended the
little bridal procession."
1675,"From her front
window she could look down the Tofton Road, leading out of St Ogg’s,
and note the growing tendency to “gadding about” in the wives of men
not retired from business, together with a practice of wearing woven
cotton stockings, which opened a dreary prospect for the coming
generation; and from her back windows she could look down the pleasant
garden and orchard which stretched to the river, and observe the folly
of Mr Glegg in spending his time among “them flowers and vegetables.”
For Mr Glegg, having retired from active business as a wool-stapler for
the purpose of enjoying himself through the rest of his life, had found
this last occupation so much more severe than his business, that he had
been driven into amateur hard labour as a dissipation, and habitually
relaxed by doing the work of two ordinary gardeners."
1676,"I do always think too much of my own
feelings, and not enough of others’,—not enough of yours."
1677,"But Rosamond was expecting to have a
baby, and Lydgate wished to save her from any perturbation."
1678,"Tom, meanwhile, had shown no disposition to rely on any one but
himself, though, with a natural sensitiveness toward all indications of
favourable opinion, he was glad to see his uncle Glegg look in on him
sometimes in a friendly way during business hours, and glad to be
invited to dine at his house, though he usually preferred declining on
the ground that he was not sure of being punctual."
1679,"Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame,
and his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it was too
languid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate delight; it
went on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking
of its wings and never flying."
1680,"Young ladies are a little ardent,
you know—a little one-sided, my dear."
1681,"It was very dreadful for that unhappy young man, but it did seem as if
the misfortune had happened then, rather than at any other time, in
order that cousin Tom might all the sooner have the fit reward of his
exemplary conduct,—papa thought so very highly of him."
1682,"He would ride to Houndsley with Bambridge
and with Horrock “the vet,” and without asking them anything expressly,
he should virtually get the benefit of their opinion."
1683,"I should know every one of the people and be their
friend.
I am going to have great consultations with Mr. Garth: he can
tell me almost everything I want to know.”
“Then you _will_ be happy, if you have a plan, Dodo?” said Celia."
1684,"“Park House stands high up out of the flood,” said Maggie."
1685,"I have
married care, not help.” And that evening he said—
“Rosamond, have you heard anything that distresses you?”
“Yes,” she answered, laying down her work, which she had been carrying
on with a languid semi-consciousness, most unlike her usual self."
1686,"And his sister, too,” continued Mrs
Glegg, looking severely at Maggie, who had sat down on the sofa by her
aunt Deane, drawn to her by the sense that she was Lucy’s mother, “she
must make up her mind to be humble and work; for there’ll be no
servants to wait on her any more,—she must remember that."
1687,"Mr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of
Pinkerton, and Mr. Brooke’s success must depend either on plumpers
which would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the new minting of Tory
votes into reforming votes."
1688,"Here is a fender which
at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve, being, as I
may say, for quality of steel and quaintness of design, a kind of
thing”—here Mr. Trumbull dropped his voice and became slightly nasal,
trimming his outlines with his left finger—“that might not fall in with
ordinary tastes."
1689,"“I’m come to stay ever so long, if Mrs
Stelling asks me."
1690,"“What is it?” said Maggie, in a whisper.
“I can see nothing but a bit
of yellow.”
“Why, it’s—a—new—guess, Maggie!”
“Oh, I _can’t_ guess, Tom,” said Maggie, impatiently."
1691,"Perhaps there was something in that sound more than the mere fact of
the strong vibration that produced the instantaneous effect on the
frame of the prostrate man, and for the time completely shook off the
obstruction of paralysis."
1692,"From beginning to end it was a passionate cry of reproach; an
appeal against her useless sacrifice of him, of herself, against that
perverted notion of right which led her to crush all his hopes, for the
sake of a mere idea, and not any substantial good,—_his_ hopes, whom
she loved, and who loved her with that single overpowering passion,
that worship, which a man never gives to a woman more than once in his
life."
1693,"He very soon set down poor Tom as a thoroughly stupid lad; for though
by hard labour he could get particular declensions into his brain,
anything so abstract as the relation between cases and terminations
could by no means get such a lodgment there as to enable him to
recognise a chance genitive or dative."
1694,"I have been thinking
about it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon’s learning he must
have before him the same materials as German scholars—has he not?”
Dorothea’s timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that she was
in the strange situation of consulting a third person about the
adequacy of Mr. Casaubon’s learning."
1695,"Maggie was
rather awe-stricken by this unusual treatment, and sometimes thought
that her conduct had been too wicked to be alluded to."
1696,"And she would carry
out the purpose with which she had started in the morning, of going to
Freshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and her uncle all that she wished
them to know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial
now presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more
ardent in readiness to be his champion."
1697,"“But he’ll want the more pay, I doubt,” said Mr Glegg."
1698,"“I must not go any farther, I
think, must I?”
“Oh no, I forgot; good-by,” said Maggie, pausing, and putting out her
hand to him."
1699,"“Sit down and let me sponge it with vinegar.”
Physically Mr. Bulstrode did not want the vinegar, but morally the
affectionate attention soothed him."
1700,"But the horror was
transient; it passed away before the oncoming warehouses of St Ogg’s."
1701,"“Yes, Miss; but I think he must be washing and dressing himself; I’ll
go and see,” said Mrs Jakin, disappearing."
1702,"Perhaps Will Ladislaw, having
heard of that strange ban against him left by Mr. Casaubon, had felt it
better that he and she should not meet again, and perhaps she was wrong
to wish for a meeting that others might find many good reasons against."
1703,"And him as I’d gone out and in wi’ for ten year and more, since
when we was lads and went halves—mine own familiar friend in whom I
trusted, had lifted up his heel again’ me, and worked to ruin me.”
“Eh, but he was a bad un—I can’t think as there’s another such,” said
Dolly."
1704,"“Not if I know it,” answered Tom, with proud sincerity."
1705,"Of course the forked lightning seemed to pass
through him when he first approached her, and he remained conscious
throughout the interview of hiding uneasiness; but, good as he was, it
must be owned that his uneasiness was less than it would have been if
he had thought his rival a brilliant and desirable match."
1706,"“I think I’ve got a great deal more than that in my steel purse
upstairs."
1707,"The little store of sovereigns in the tin box seemed
to be the only sight that brought a faint beam of pleasure into the
miller’s eyes,—faint and transient, for it was soon dispelled by the
thought that the time would be long—perhaps longer than his
life,—before the narrow savings could remove the hateful incubus of
debt."
1708,"But Wrench had a wretched
lymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl;
and he must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen domestic
apparatus."
1709,"“Ah, Mr Philip!” said Mr Deane, when they entered the dining-room,
“I’ve not seen you for a long while."
1710,"“Why, Wakem is making himself particularly amiable to your cousin,”
said Stephen, in an undertone to Lucy; “is it pure magnanimity?"
1711,"But Maggie, as she stood crying before the glass, felt it
impossible that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes
and severe words of her aunts, while Tom and Lucy, and Martha, who
waited at table, and perhaps her father and her uncles, would laugh at
her; for if Tom had laughed at her, of course every one else would; and
if she had only let her hair alone, she could have sat with Tom and
Lucy, and had the apricot pudding and the custard!"
1712,"He would never have
contradicted her, and when a woman is not contradicted, she has no
motive for obstinacy in her absurdities."
1713,"The knife would do no good on the ground there; it
wouldn’t vex Tom; and pride or resentment was a feeble passion in Bob’s
mind compared with the love of a pocket-knife."
1714,"“So much the better,” thought Celia.
“But how strangely Dodo goes from
one extreme to the other.”
The next day, at luncheon, the butler, handing something to Mr. Brooke,
said, “Jonas is come back, sir, and has brought this letter.”
Mr. Brooke read the letter, and then, nodding toward Dorothea, said,
“Casaubon, my dear: he will be here to dinner; he didn’t wait to write
more—didn’t wait, you know.”
It could not seem remarkable to Celia that a dinner guest should be
announced to her sister beforehand, but, her eyes following the same
direction as her uncle’s, she was struck with the peculiar effect of
the announcement on Dorothea."
1715,"“Nay, child,” said Silas, “I’ve done enough for to-day."
1716,"Since you are my tutor, you ought to preserve my mind from prejudices;
you are always arguing against prejudices.”
“Well, perhaps you will avenge the dark women in your own person, and
carry away all the love from your cousin Lucy."
1717,"I shall gain enough if you will take me with you there.”
“How should I be able now to persevere in any path without your
companionship?” said Mr. Casaubon, kissing her candid brow, and feeling
that heaven had vouchsafed him a blessing in every way suited to his
peculiar wants."
1718,"He was silent a few moments, not looking at her; while
her eyes were turned toward him yearningly, in alarm at this sudden
change."
1719,"Pray make haste and put another on.”
Lucy hurried out of the room, but Maggie did not take the opportunity
of opening her book; she let it fall on her knees, while her eyes
wandered to the window, where she could see the sunshine falling on the
rich clumps of spring flowers and on the long hedge of laurels, and
beyond, the silvery breadth of the dear old Floss, that at this
distance seemed to be sleeping in a morning holiday."
1720,"The sun was
rising now, and the wide area of watery desolation was spread out in
dreadful clearness around them; in dreadful clearness floated onward
the hurrying, threatening masses."
1721,"Those green boughs, the
hymn and anthem never heard but at Christmas—even the Athanasian Creed,
which was discriminated from the others only as being longer and of
exceptional virtue, since it was only read on rare occasions—brought a
vague exulting sense, for which the grown men could as little have
found words as the children, that something great and mysterious had
been done for them in heaven above and in earth below, which they were
appropriating by their presence."
1722,"The men were strong enough to
bear up and keep quiet under this confused suspense; some letting their
lower lip fall, others pursing it up, according to the habit of their
muscles."
1723,"I
might think society at St Ogg’s agreeable then.
But nothing could make
life worth the purchase-money of pain to me, but some faculty that
would lift me above the dead level of provincial existence."
1724,"I suppose it was that
in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and
the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee
delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal."
1725,"Her anger said, as anger is apt to
say, that God was with her—that all heaven, though it were crowded with
spirits watching them, must be on her side."
1726,"That is a sort of revenge which
falls into the scale of virtue, and Wakem was not without an intention
of keeping that scale respectably filled."
1727,"Maggie, thinking it was no use to contend further, began too, and ate
up her half puff with considerable relish as well as rapidity."
1728,"Her cordial look, when she put out her hand
to him, softened his expression, but only with melancholy."
1729,"He had not meant to look at her
or speak to her with more than the inevitable amount of admiration and
compliment which a man must give to a beautiful girl; indeed, it seemed
to him that his enjoyment of her music had remained almost silent, for
he feared falling into the rudeness of telling her his great surprise
at her possession of such accomplishment."
1730,"When they went down, uncle Pullet observed, with some acumen, that he
reckoned the missis had been showing her bonnet,—that was what had made
them so long upstairs."
1731,"“It would require all your knowledge to be able to read
it.”
Mr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will."
1732,"“Well, you mustn’t mind stooping and getting hot.”
“I don’t mind anything."
1733,"You and I cannot have opposite interests.
I cannot part my
happiness from yours."
1734,"But he had not moral courage enough to contemplate that active
renunciation of Nancy as possible for him: he had only conscience and
heart enough to make him for ever uneasy under the weakness that
forbade the renunciation."
1735,"But this was spoken of in the village
as the random talk of youth, “as if it was only Mr. Snell who had seen
something odd about the pedlar!” On the contrary, there were at least
half-a-dozen who were ready to go before Justice Malam, and give in
much more striking testimony than any the landlord could furnish."
1736,"Laborers can never pay rent to make it answer.
But, after all, it
is worth doing.”
“Worth doing!"
1737,"She had rushed into the adventure of seeking her unknown
kindred, the gypsies; and now she was in this strange lane, she hardly
dared look on one side of her, lest she should see the diabolical
blacksmith in his leathern apron grinning at her with arms akimbo."
1738,"But the
consequence is, that the whole profession in Middlemarch have set
themselves tooth and nail against the Hospital, and not only refuse to
cooperate themselves, but try to blacken the whole affair and hinder
subscriptions.”
“How very petty!” exclaimed Dorothea, indignantly."
1739,"Maggie’s only hope was that something might, for the first time, have
prevented Philip from coming."
1740,"She had
arrived at a spot where her footsteps were no longer checked by a
hedgerow, and she had wandered vaguely, unable to distinguish any
objects, notwithstanding the wide whiteness around her, and the growing
starlight."
1741,"And he
may have tampered with the patient—he may have disobeyed my orders.
I
fear he did."
1742,"But the last fortnight Mary had been staying at
Lowick Parsonage with the ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother’s
residence in Middlemarch, where he was carrying out some parochial
plans; and Fred, not seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned
into the Green Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the
old flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general,
considered from a point of view which was not strenuously correct."
1743,"The banker felt that he had done something to nullify one cause of
uneasiness, and yet he was scarcely the easier."
1744,"But heaven knows where that striving might lead
us, if our affections had not a trick of twining round those old
inferior things; if the loves and sanctities of our life had no deep
immovable roots in memory."
1745,"So our mercurial Ladislaw has a queer
genealogy!
A high-spirited young lady and a musical Polish patriot made
a likely enough stock for him to spring from, but I should never have
suspected a grafting of the Jew pawnbroker."
1746,"The revelation about the money must be made the very
next morning; and if he withheld the rest, Dunstan would be sure to
come back shortly, and, finding that he must bear the brunt of his
father’s anger, would tell the whole story out of spite, even though he
had nothing to gain by it."
1747,"You won’t hate me
really, will you, Tom?”
“Oh, bother!"
1748,"I recommend you at
present, as your clergyman, and one who hopes for your reinstatement in
respect, to quit the room, and avoid further hindrance to business.”
Bulstrode, after a moment’s hesitation, took his hat from the floor and
slowly rose, but he grasped the corner of the chair so totteringly that
Lydgate felt sure there was not strength enough in him to walk away
without support."
1749,"“Why didn’t he use his
interest to get Ladislaw made an _attache_ or sent to India?"
1750,"If to
Dorothea Mr. Casaubon had been the mere occasion which had set alight
the fine inflammable material of her youthful illusions, does it follow
that he was fairly represented in the minds of those less impassioned
personages who have hitherto delivered their judgments concerning him?"
1751,"The
attention that Tom might have concentrated on his nuts and wine was
distracted by a sense that there were rascally enemies in the world,
and that the business of grown-up life could hardly be conducted
without a good deal of quarrelling."
1752,"These were the mental conditions on which Mrs Tulliver had undertaken
to act persuasively, and had failed; a fact which may receive some
illustration from the remark of a great philosopher, that fly-fishers
fail in preparing their bait so as to make it alluring in the right
quarter, for want of a due acquaintance with the subjectivity of
fishes."
1753,"“With regard to what
you say, Mr. Lydgate, about the relaxation of my mental labor, I have
for some time been entertaining a purpose to that effect—a purpose of a
very decided character."
1754,"That was a lie.
It may do a bit of harm here and there, to
this and to that; and so does the sun in heaven."
1755,"Not as I’m one o’ those as
’ud like to die without leaving more money out at interest than other
folks had reckoned; but it’s a poor tale when it must go out o’ your
own family.”
“I’m sure, sister,” said Mrs Pullet, who had recovered sufficiently to
take off her veil and fold it carefully, “it’s a nice sort o’ man as
Mrs Sutton has left her money to, for he’s troubled with the asthmy,
and goes to bed every night at eight o’clock."
1756,"“Worship is usually a matter of
theory rather than of practice.
But I am practising it to excess just
at this moment—I must really tear myself away.”
“Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music,
and I cannot enjoy it so well without him.”
When her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of
him and holding his coat-collar with both her hands, “Mr."
1757,"She was blind, you see, to many things obvious to others—likely to
tread in the wrong places, as Celia had warned her; yet her blindness
to whatever did not lie in her own pure purpose carried her safely by
the side of precipices where vision would have been perilous with fear."
1758,"Tom thought snuff-taking a most
provoking habit.
“Why, let me see, how old are you?” said Mr Deane, as he threw himself
backward again."
1759,"Their religion
was of a simple, semi-pagan kind, but there was no heresy in it,—if
heresy properly means choice,—for they didn’t know there was any other
religion, except that of chapel-goers, which appeared to run in
families, like asthma."
1760,"’T is strange to see the humors of these men,
These great aspiring spirits, that should be wise:
."
1761,"“Precisely; you cannot conceive,” said Mrs. Garth, cutting her words as
neatly as possible."
1762,"He left home
the next morning in that watchful state of mind which turns the most
ordinary course of things into pregnant coincidences."
1763,"He did not know where the chain went; an idea had thrilled
through the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in
raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed
sepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced mould."
1764,"“By the way,” he said, “what has become of Trawley?"
1765,"Dorothea left Ladislaw’s two letters unread on her husband’s
writing-table and went to her own place, the scorn and indignation
within her rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl away
any trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean
cupidity."
1766,"“There’s no law again’ flea-bites.
If I wasn’t to take a fool in now
and then, he’d niver get any wiser."
1767,"But this will cuts out
everything.
If I’d known, a wagon and six horses shouldn’t have drawn
me from Brassing."
1768,"Now Mary’s gone out, I must tell
you a thing—it’s only known to Susan and me, and you’ll not tell it
again."
1769,"But she also liked to think
that it was well in every sense for Mr. Bulstrode to have won the hand
of Harriet Vincy; whose family was undeniable in a Middlemarch light—a
better light surely than any thrown in London thoroughfares or
dissenting chapel-yards."
1770,"That was the object which Will stated to himself as a reason for coming
down."
1771,"And yet what else am I to do?
My father can’t spare me any
capital, else I might go into farming."
1772,"“I beseech you to tell me how everything was,” said Dorothea,
fearlessly."
1773,"I am sure I have heard papa say that
the Torbits were in debt, and they went on very well."
1774,"But he himself
dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for
such a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s
objections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is
to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of
gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire."
1775,"People say what they like to say, not what they have chapter
and verse for,” said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the truths that
lay on the side of his own wishes."
1776,"Lucy was naturally pleased that
cousin Tom was so good to her, and it was very amusing to see him
tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down
the area, with an iron grating over him."
1777,"He spoke kindly.
“Dear Rosy, lay down your work and come to sit by me,” he said, gently,
pushing away the table, and stretching out his arm to draw a chair near
his own."
1778,"“You forgot to feed ’em, then, and Harry forgot?” he said, his colour
heightening for a moment, but soon subsiding."
1779,"It had just occurred to Mr. Snell, the
landlord—he being, as he observed, a man accustomed to put two and two
together—to connect with the tinder-box, which, as deputy-constable, he
himself had had the honourable distinction of finding, certain
recollections of a pedlar who had called to drink at the house about a
month before, and had actually stated that he carried a tinder-box
about with him to light his pipe."
1780,"Are you turning out a scamp?
I tell you I won’t have
it."
1781,"The reason he
told me was because I was very bold and asked him."
1782,"Pray, where lie such lands now?
Why, where they lay of old—in human souls."
1783,"The rejoinder to
this was the first shrug.
Then he laughed at himself for being likely
to have felt jealous, as if he had been a man able to marry, which,
added he, it is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not."
1784,"“I’m fit to speak to something better than you, you poor-spirited imp!”
said Tom, lighting up immediately at Philip’s fire."
1785,"As I said when Mr. Baldwin, the
tax-gatherer, comes in, a-standing where you sit, and says, ‘Bulstrode
got all his money as he brought into this town by thieving and
swindling,’—I said, ‘You don’t make me no wiser, Mr. Baldwin: it’s set
my blood a-creeping to look at him ever sin’ here he came into
Slaughter Lane a-wanting to buy the house over my head: folks don’t
look the color o’ the dough-tub and stare at you as if they wanted to
see into your backbone for nothingk.’ That was what I said, and Mr.
Baldwin can bear me witness.”
“And in the rights of it too,” said Mr. Crabbe."
1786,"“Then, dear one, in spite of all, you have been the blessing of my
    life."
1787,"It was certainly more agreeable to
have an ill-natured humpback as a companion than to stand looking out
of the study window at the rain, and kicking his foot against the
washboard in solitude; something would happen every day,—“a quarrel or
something”; and Tom thought he should rather like to show Philip that
he had better not try his spiteful tricks on _him_."
1788,"As for Bulstrode—when Will was gone he suffered a violent reaction, and
wept like a woman."
1789,"A large company in a boat that was
working its way along under the Tofton houses observed their danger,
and shouted, “Get out of the current!”
But that could not be done at once; and Tom, looking before him, saw
death rushing on them."
1790,"But that simplicity of hers, holding up an
ideal for others in her believing conception of them, was one of the
great powers of her womanhood."
1791,"I suppose one good resolve might keep a man right if
everybody else’s resolve helped him.”
The Vicar’s talk was not always inspiriting: he had escaped being a
Pharisee, but he had not escaped that low estimate of possibilities
which we rather hastily arrive at as an inference from our own failure."
1792,"He had no
sense of being eclipsed by Mr. Casaubon; he was only shocked that
Dorothea was under a melancholy illusion, and his mortification lost
some of its bitterness by being mingled with compassion."
1793,"But he was still
left alone in it when the congregation had assembled.
The curate’s pew
was opposite the rector’s at the entrance of the small chancel, and
Will had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he looked
round at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year
to year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with
more change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and
there with age, but yet has young shoots."
1794,"“He couldn’t choose his father, you know; and I’ve read of very
bad men who had good sons, as well as good parents who had bad
children."
1795,"Stern reason is my forte, you know.
You must get Philip to
buy those."
1796,"Then turning to Will, she said, “I have
some memoranda to write for the housekeeper.”
“I must go,” said Will, when the door had closed again—advancing
towards her."
1797,"The love she had renounced came back
upon her with a cruel charm; she felt herself opening her arms to
receive it once more; and then it seemed to slip away and fade and
vanish, leaving only the dying sound of a deep, thrilling voice that
said, “Gone, forever gone.”
BOOK SEVENTH
THE FINAL RESCUE."
1798,"“For I shouldn’t ha’ said anything about it,” she
added, half-bashfully, half-roguishly, “only Mrs. Winthrop said as
Aaron ’ud be so good, and—”
“And you might ha’ known it without mother telling you,” said Aaron."
1799,"If I were Brooke, I would choke the ‘Trumpet’ at
once by getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and giving
him _carte blanche_ about gates and repairs: that’s my view of the
political situation,” said the Rector, broadening himself by sticking
his thumbs in his armholes, and laughing towards Mr. Brooke."
1800,"But I came back to tell you: there was no hindering it; you
must know.”
He was silent, looking on the ground for two long minutes."
1801,"Marner went home, and for a whole day sat alone, stunned by despair,
without any impulse to go to Sarah and attempt to win her belief in his
innocence."
1802,"They had gone forth together into their life of sorrow, and they would
never more see the sunshine undimmed by remembered cares."
1803,"“Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful?” said Dorothea
to him, one morning, early in the time of courtship; “could I not learn
to read Latin and Greek aloud to you, as Milton’s daughters did to
their father, without understanding what they read?”
“I fear that would be wearisome to you,” said Mr. Casaubon, smiling;
“and, indeed, if I remember rightly, the young women you have mentioned
regarded that exercise in unknown tongues as a ground for rebellion
against the poet.”
“Yes; but in the first place they were very naughty girls, else they
would have been proud to minister to such a father; and in the second
place they might have studied privately and taught themselves to
understand what they read, and then it would have been interesting."
1804,"What people do who go into
politics I can’t think: it drives me almost mad to see mismanagement
over only a few hundred acres.”
It was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech, but his
happiness had the effect of mountain air: his eyes were bright, and the
words came without effort."
1805,"It is pleasant to know that a new ministry just come into
office are not the only fellow-men who enjoy a period of high
appreciation and full-blown eulogy; in many respectable families
throughout this realm, relatives becoming creditable meet with a
similar cordiality of recognition, which in its fine freedom from the
coercion of any antecedents, suggests the hopeful possibility that we
may some day without any notice find ourselves in full millennium, with
cockatrices who have ceased to bite, and wolves that no longer show
their teeth with any but the blandest intentions."
1806,"Silas Marner’s determination to keep the “tramp’s child” was matter of
hardly less surprise and iterated talk in the village than the robbery
of his money."
1807,"“Is she dead?” said the voice that predominated over every other within
him."
1808,"Our vanities differ as our
noses do: all conceit is not the same conceit, but varies in
correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us
differs from another."
1809,"Mr. Featherstone was still applauding the last performance, and
assuring missy that her voice was as clear as a blackbird’s, when Mr.
Lydgate’s horse passed the window."
1810,"He glanced at his son as he entered the room, and said, “What, sir!"
1811,"She chose to be silent, and her aunt went away all
the more convinced."
1812,"“But what a
pity it is you should work of a Sunday, and not clean yourself—if you
_didn’t_ go to church; for if you’d a roasting bit, it might be as you
couldn’t leave it, being a lone man."
1813,"A
Dodson would not be taxed with the omission of anything that was
becoming, or that belonged to that eternal fitness of things which was
plainly indicated in the practice of the most substantial parishioners,
and in the family traditions,—such as obedience to parents,
faithfulness to kindred, industry, rigid honesty, thrift, the thorough
scouring of wooden and copper utensils, the hoarding of coins likely to
disappear from the currency, the production of first-rate commodities
for the market, and the general preference of whatever was home-made."
1814,"He
sat in unaltered calm, and, in fact, the company, preoccupied with more
important problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests
which might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of him."
1815,"A wife’s got a right to ask that, I hope.”
“Don’t you be uneasy, mum,” said Bob, touching his cap."
1816,"They lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart, Lydgate
going about what work he had in a mood of despair, and Rosamond
feeling, with some justification, that he was behaving cruelly."
1817,"“What ’ud Mr Stelling say to me?”
“Oh, I say, do, Mr Poulter!"
1818,"That was not altogether
his own fault, since one of the thousand pounds was his sister’s
fortune, which he had to pay on her marriage; and a man who has
neighbours that _will_ go to law with him is not likely to pay off his
mortgages, especially if he enjoys the good opinion of acquaintances
who want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too lofty to be
represented by parchment."
1819,"She threw off her mantle and
bonnet, and sat down opposite to him, enjoying the glow, but lifting up
her beautiful hands for a screen."
1820,"They’ll have to give up for
to-day, and it will be as well."
1821,"Who would neglect such a profitable investment?
Certainly not Furley, for Mr Tulliver had determined that Furley should
meet his plans with the utmost alacrity; and there are men whoses
brains have not yet been dangerously heated by the loss of a lawsuit,
who are apt to see in their own interest or desires a motive for other
men’s actions."
1822,"When Mr. Vincy came home he was very angry with Wrench, and did not
care if he never came into his house again."
1823,"It is in such indefinable movements that action
often begins.
But the last thing likely to have entered Fred’s expectation was that
he should see his brother-in-law Lydgate—of whom he had never quite
dropped the old opinion that he was a prig, and tremendously conscious
of his superiority—looking excited and betting, just as he himself
might have done."
1824,"“Certainly,” said good Sir James.
“Miss Brooke shall not be urged to
tell reasons she would rather be silent upon."
1825,"I can’t live with any one, or be dependent
on them, tell aunt Glegg; I must get my own bread."
1826,"“Well, Rosy,” he said, standing over her, and touching her hair, “what
do you think of Mrs. Casaubon now you have seen so much of her?”
“I think she must be better than any one,” said Rosamond, “and she is
very beautiful."
1827,"You have
been a curse to your best friends.
You have been base, deceitful; no
motives are strong enough to restrain you."
1828,"He was not going to renounce his ride because of his
friend’s unpleasant news—only to ride the faster in some other
direction than that of Tipton Grange."
1829,"The man was still in the making, as much as
the Middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer, and there were both
virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding."
1830,"But Maggie’s face, made more childlike by the gathering tears,
touched him with a tenderer, less egotistic feeling."
1831,"They was all
bound alike,—it’s a good binding, you see,—and I thought they’d be all
good books."
1832,"“I dare say she likes you better than the property,” said Rosamond,
looking at him from a distance."
1833,"“Well, you know, Chettam,” he said, rising, taking up his hat and
leaning on his stick, “you and I have a different system."
1834,"In
holding this conviction Mr Stelling was not biassed, as some tutors
have been, by the excessive accuracy or extent of his own scholarship;
and as to his views about Euclid, no opinion could have been freer from
personal partiality."
1835,"They thought us sweet enough then,” said Mr Glegg,
winking pleasantly; while Mr Pullet, at the suggestion of sweetness,
took a little more sugar."
1836,"“_You_, say you’ll give me the halfpenny now,” he said, with
difficulty, while he exerted himself to keep the command of Bob’s arms."
1837,"“Only I want to keep myself independent about Reform,
you know; I don’t want to go too far."
1838,"If a man should give all his
substance, yet it is as nothing."
1839,"It was no surprise to me.
I was certain that he
    had prevailed on you to sacrifice everything to him, and I waited
    with equal certainty to hear of your marriage."
1840,"I fear there was a little temper in her
reply.
“I hope when we get to Lowick, I shall be more useful to you,
and be able to enter a little more into what interests you.”
“Doubtless, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon, with a slight bow."
1841,"And it would, I think, be
beneficial to you: it would be an advantageous way of managing the land
which I mean to be yours.”
She looked attentive."
1842,"“You have always a good reason
for your opinions, but this astonishes me."
1843,"He might have all the satisfaction
attendant on selling his brother’s horse, and not the less have the
further satisfaction of setting Godfrey to borrow Marner’s money."
1844,"And I’d have
you know, sir, you _must_ ha’ done with ’em,” said the Squire, frowning
and casting an angry glance at his son."
1845,"The problem these
gentlemen had to solve was to readjust the proportion between their
wants and their income; and since wants are not easily starved to
death, the simpler method appeared to be to raise their income."
1846,"She was getting away from Tipton and Freshitt, and her own sad
liability to tread in the wrong places on her way to the New Jerusalem."
1847,"I suspect that you have some false belief in the virtues
of misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom.” Will had gone
further than he intended, and checked himself."
1848,"“No, dear, you would have to feel with me, else you would never know.”
CHAPTER LXXXV."
1849,"He slept upon that idea, but when he was dressing in the rational
morning light, Objection said—
“That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon’s prohibition to visit
Lowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.”
“Nonsense!” argued Inclination, “it would be too monstrous for him to
hinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a spring
morning."
1850,"But Mr. Casaubon will soon be here again, I hope.
Is
he not making progress?”
“Yes, much more rapid progress than I at first expected."
1851,"She could hear shouts from
the windows overlooking the river, as if the people there were calling
to her."
1852,"“There’s a fire in the
smoking-room on purpose.
It’s your father’s wish, you know—Fred, my
dear—and I always tell him you will be good, and go to college again to
take your degree.”
Fred drew his mother’s hand down to his lips, but said nothing."
1853,"“Adieu, ‘graceful consort,’” said Stephen, buttoning his coat across
when he had done singing, and smiling down from his tall height, with
the air of rather a patronizing lover, at the little lady on the
music-stool."
1854,"He is very gentlemanly, I suppose.
They
say he is of excellent family—his relations quite county people.”
“Yes,” said Fred."
1855,"“You are as bad as Elinor.
She has been
wanting me to go and lecture Brooke; and I have reminded her that her
friends had a very poor opinion of the match she made when she married
me.”
“But look at Casaubon,” said Sir James, indignantly."
1856,"What was life worth—what great
faith was possible when the whole effect of one’s actions could be
withered up into such parched rubbish as that?"
1857,"We mustn’t be thinking o’ what’s unnecessary.
A
table, and a chair or two, and kitchen things, and a good bed, and
such-like."
1858,"Why Mr. Wrench should
neglect her children more than others, she could not for the life of
her understand."
1859,"this is just what might have been expected,” was his
immediate thought."
1860,"Moreover, he was beginning
to feel some zest for the growing though half-suppressed feud between
him and the other medical men, which was likely to become more
manifest, now that Bulstrode’s method of managing the new hospital was
about to be declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that his
non-acceptance by some of Peacock’s patients might be counterbalanced
by the impression he had produced in other quarters."
1861,"are you ever coming in?—or may I eat your cake?”
FINALE."
1862,"When I chose my wife, I chose her the
right size,—neither too little nor too big.”
The poor wife, with her withered beauty, smiled complacently."
1863,"“She is a good creature—that fine girl—but a little too earnest,” he
thought."
1864,"But Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and all the needy exiles, held a
different point of view."
1865,"I’ll write to him
about it, if you like.”
Mr Tulliver rubbed his knees, and looked at the carpet in a meditative
manner."
1866,"Would he be so lost to propriety as to
marry her before the year was out?"
1867,"The dark
afternoons and the first December snow seemed to him far livelier than
the August sunshine; and that he might make himself the surer about the
flight of the days that were carrying him homeward, he stuck twenty-one
sticks deep in a corner of the garden, when he was three weeks from the
holidays, and pulled one up every day with a great wrench, throwing it
to a distance with a vigor of will which would have carried it to
limbo, if it had been in the nature of sticks to travel so far."
1868,"She begged leave for her daughters to sit
with their father, and drove into the town to pay some visits,
conjecturing that if anything were known to have gone wrong in Mr.
Bulstrode’s affairs, she should see or hear some sign of it."
1869,"Obligation may be stretched till it is no better than
a brand of slavery stamped on us when we were too young to know its
meaning."
1870,"But confidences are sometimes blinding, even when they are
sincere.
Brother and Sister
Maggie was obliged to go to Tom’s lodgings in the middle of the day,
when he would be coming in to dinner, else she would not have found him
at home."
1871,"But now—would Dorothea meet him in that world
again?
“And now good-morrow to our waking souls
Which watch not one another out of fear;
For love all love of other sights controls,
And makes one little room, an everywhere.”
—DR."
1872,It was the fashion at Lowick for “the betters” to go out first.
1873,"It was more bearable
to do without tenderness for himself than to see that his own
tenderness could make no amends for the lack of other things to her."
1874,"She is
doing a wonderful bust of Dr Kenn entirely from memory.”
“Why, if she can remember to put the eyes very near together, and the
corners of the mouth very far apart, the likeness can hardly fail to be
striking in St Ogg’s.”
“Now that is very wicked of you,” said Lucy, looking rather hurt."
1875,"I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to
make that weaker.
I should like better than anything to see him worthy
of every one’s respect."
1876,"He could see every
object in his cottage—and his gold was not there.
Again he put his trembling hands to his head, and gave a wild ringing
scream, the cry of desolation."
1877,"Dorothea was still hurt and agitated.
“It is quite decided, then?” said Celia, in an awed under tone."
1878,"That ought to be
altered; and no time ought to be lost.
This very question which had
just arisen about Will Ladislaw’s occupation, was the occasion for
placing things on a new, right footing."
1879,"I must inquire into the matter, and go
into it with Mr Guest."
1880,"And how very uncomfortable Sir James would be!
I cannot bear
notions.”
It was Celia’s private luxury to indulge in this dislike."
1881,"She dropped them, and started up as Tom spoke.
“Oh, my boy, my boy!” she said, clasping him round the neck."
1882,"It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the
tones that stirred Silas’s heart grew articulate, and called for more
distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was imperatively required to
notice and account for."
1883,"I suppose it’s because I niver went
to school much.
That’s what I jaw my old mother for."
1884,"“I think all women are crosser than men,” said Maggie.
“Aunt Glegg’s a
great deal crosser than uncle Glegg, and mother scolds me more than
father does.”
“Well, _you’ll_ be a woman some day,” said Tom, “so _you_ needn’t
talk.”
“But I shall be a _clever_ woman,” said Maggie, with a toss."
1885,"Dorothea sank back in her chair when her uncle had left the room, and
cast her eyes down meditatively on her crossed hands."
1886,"Her presence of mind and
adroitness in carrying out his hints were admirable, and it is not
wonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with
his interest in the case."
1887,"Gold!—his own gold—brought back to him as mysteriously as it had been
taken away!"
1888,"She had a moment of real happiness then,—a moment of belief that, if
there were sacrifice in this love, it was all the richer and more
satisfying."
1889,"_Please_ be good to me.”
Tom’s arm slowly relaxed, and he said, “Well, then, it’s a new
fish-line—two new uns,—one for you, Maggie, all to yourself."
1890,"He once told me not to speak to you again, and he doesn’t change
his mind—Oh dear, the sun is set."
1891,"For she’ll get busier and mischievouser every day—she will, bless her."
1892,"Notions and scruples were like spilt
needles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even
eating."
1893,"It was a
fine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some
prospect of an understanding between Bagster’s committee and Brooke’s,
to which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such
manufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which
almost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for
Pinkerton at the Green Dragon."
1894,"Lydgate was playing well, and felt confident; the bets were
dropping round him, and with a swift glancing thought of the probable
gain which might double the sum he was saving from his horse, he began
to bet on his own play, and won again and again."
1895,"what a queer thing you look!
Look at yourself
in the glass; you look like the idiot we throw out nutshells to at
school.”
Maggie felt an unexpected pang."
1896,"“I’m very sorry for any pain you
have to go through; but it is of no use to speak.”
“Yes, it _is_ of use,” said Stephen, impetuously."
1897,"But about the ‘Pioneer,’ I have been consulting a
little with some of the men on our side, and they are inclined to take
it into their hands—indemnify me to a certain extent—carry it on, in
fact."
1898,"This is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of putting the
case."
1899,"Dorothea’s heart was full of something that she
wanted to say, and yet the words were too difficult."
1900,"It was clear
that the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged to
turn out of his old place, and look like a ruined man."
1901,"Here one has
conventional worldly notions and habits without instruction and without
polish, surely the most prosaic form of human life; proud
respectability in a gig of unfashionable build; worldliness without
side-dishes."
1902,"“The highest object to me is my
profession, and I had identified the Hospital with the best use I can
at present make of my profession."
1903,"She constructed a little romance which was to
vary the flatness of her life: Will Ladislaw was always to be a
bachelor and live near her, always to be at her command, and have an
understood though never fully expressed passion for her, which would be
sending out lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes."
1904,"Mr. Wrench was again sent for, but
was gone on his rounds, and Mrs. Vincy seeing her darling’s changed
looks and general misery, began to cry and said she would send for Dr.
Sprague."
1905,"Mr Tulliver, seeing signs of acquirement beyond the reach of
his own criticism, thought it was probably all right with Tom’s
education; he observed, indeed, that there were no maps, and not enough
“summing”; but he made no formal complaint to Mr Stelling."
1906,"Let but Pumpkin have a figure which would sustain the
disadvantages of the shortwaisted swallow-tail, and everybody felt it
not only natural but necessary to the perfection of womanhood, that a
sweet girl should be at once convinced of his virtue, his exceptional
ability, and above all, his perfect sincerity."
1907,"Practically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an
impatience of everything in which the parson doesn’t cut the principal
figure."
1908,"“Has it made you hate me, Maggie?” said Philip, impetuously."
1909,"And there must be a little crack in the Brooke family, else we
should not see what we are to see.”
“What?"
1910,"You are fatigued, and it
may soon rain; it may be a wretched business, getting to Torby in this
boat."
1911,"It’s disgusting.” Here Caleb tossed the paper
from him.
Any stranger peeping into the office at that moment might have wondered
what was the drama between the indignant man of business, and the
fine-looking young fellow whose blond complexion was getting rather
patchy as he bit his lip with mortification."
1912,"Dorothea had less of outward vision than usual this morning, being
filled with images of things as they had been and were going to be."
1913,"Her
roused temper made her color deeply, as she returned his greeting with
some haughtiness."
1914,"I think, all things considered, it will be best for
you to see Philip Wakem, if Lucy wishes him to come to the house."
1915,"Thank ye, sir, thank ye,” said
Dagley, with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep-dog stir
from his seat and prick his ears; but seeing Monk enter the yard after
some outside loitering, Fag seated himself again in an attitude of
observation."
1916,"But if my father had made up his
mind to give my aunt the money before he was in debt, he had a right to
do it.”
“Well done, young man!"
1917,"They say Fortune is a woman and capricious.
But sometimes
she is a good woman and gives to those who merit, which has been the
case with you, Mrs. Casaubon, who have given a living to my son.”
Mrs. Farebrother recurred to her knitting with a dignified satisfaction
in her neat little effort at oratory, but this was not what Dorothea
wanted to hear."
1918,"You was never brought up
in that way, Bessy.”
“Why, Jane, what can I do?"
1919,"As
if a man could choose not only his wife but his wife’s husband!"
1920,"Dr Kenn would perhaps
help her and advise her.
She remembered his parting words at the
bazaar."
1921,"I’d have you to remember, sir, my property’s got no entail
on it;—since my grandfather’s time the Casses can do as they like with
their land."
1922,"“He’s come on
Sindbad, as I told him.
I was afraid he was not going to keep his
promise.”
Maggie jumped up to kiss Tom as he entered, with strong feeling, at
this first meeting since the prospect of returning to the Mill had been
opened to him; and she kept his hand, leading him to the chair by her
side."
1923,"You have
been reproaching other people all your life; you have been always sure
you yourself are right."
1924,"That was Dunstan’s first thought as he approached it;
the second was, that the old fool of a weaver, whose loom he heard
rattling already, had a great deal of money hidden somewhere."
1925,"There’s my wife now, she never has an answer at her
tongue’s end; but if I offend her, she’s sure to scarify my throat with
black pepper the next day, or else give me the colic with watery
greens."
1926,"He sat down again, and felt
that he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was
with one who believed in it."
1927,"Much rumination had Mr Tulliver on these puzzling subjects during his
rides on the gray horse; much turning of the head from side to side, as
the scales dipped alternately; but the probable result was still out of
sight, only to be reached through much hot argument and iteration in
domestic and social life."
1928,"As Dorothea entered the library, Mr. Casaubon turned round from the
table where he had been placing some books, and said—
“I was waiting for your appearance, my dear."
1929,"You can both of
you go on quarrelling with all the world and with each other on those
two topics.”
Rosamond looked mildly neutral as she said this, rising to ring the
bell, and then crossing to her work-table."
1930,"Bulstrode carried his candle to the bedside of Raffles, who was
apparently in a painful dream."
1931,"and why should he come on this particular night, when he
had never come through all the fifteen years before?"
1932,"Mr Deane, he considered, was the “knowingest” man of his
acquaintance, and he had besides a ready causticity of tongue that made
an agreeable supplement to Mr Tulliver’s own tendency that way, which
had remained in rather an inarticulate condition."
1933,"“But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought of anything
in the matter except what was most for your welfare.”
“She has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love, now she
has married him,” said Will to himself."
1934,"The “mammy” was not
a cry of need or uneasiness: Baby had been used to utter it without
expecting either tender sound or touch to follow."
1935,"She won’t be
displeased; you’ll have plenty of time to go by-and-by; and I don’t
want you to go out of the way just now.”
“Yes, indeed I must go, dear; I can’t put it off."
1936,"Ladislaw’s shoes, I would,” said Henrietta Noble.
Dorothea made an attempt at smiling in return."
1937,"It was known that the
daughter had married, but she was utterly gone out of sight."
1938,"“And by-and-by, I hope,
you may be in circumstances gradually to repay me."
1939,"Perhaps something akin to this oppressive feeling may have weighed upon
you in watching this old-fashioned family life on the banks of the
Floss, which even sorrow hardly suffices to lift above the level of the
tragi-comic."
1940,"He left the letter at the office, ordering the messenger to
carry it to Lowick Manor, and wait for an answer."
1941,"A good degree of that effect was
just then present in Fred Vincy.
“I will try to be worthy,” he said, breaking off before he could say
“of you as well as of her.” And meanwhile Mr. Farebrother had gathered
the impulse to say something more."
1942,"“I’ll pitch into Harry.
I’ll have him turned away."
1943,"“I should have thought there were many other means than that,” said
Rosamond."
1944,"Stephen at last sat upright
sideways in his chair, leaning one hand and arm over the back and
looking at Maggie."
1945,"Let him forsake a decent craft that he may pursue the gentilities
of a profession to which nature never called him, and his religion will
infallibly be the worship of blessed Chance, which he will believe in
as the mighty creator of success."
1946,"“I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,” he went on, “but I
will never again, if I can help it, do or say what you would
disapprove.”
“That is very good of you,” said Dorothea, with another open smile."
1947,"And now his school years
seemed like a holiday that had come to an end."
1948,"Here were new possibilities, raising a new uncertainty,
which almost checked remark in the mourning-coaches."
1949,"Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than
anxiety about what we have got to say."
1950,"He was accustomed to receive large
orders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there were many of
Pinkerton’s committee whose opinions had a great weight of grocery on
their side."
1951,"And there’s
no better reason, you know, than your being my nephew; because it
remains to be seen whether you’re good for anything.”
“I hope I shall never do you any discredit, uncle,” said Tom, hurt, as
all boys are at the statement of the unpleasant truth that people feel
no ground for trusting them."
1952,"I said, ‘My dear, you
don’t know what it is to live on seven hundred a-year, and have no
carriage, and that kind of thing, and go amongst people who don’t know
who you are.’ I put it strongly to her."
1953,"Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate’s
presence but its effect: she liked to excite jealousy."
1954,"The poor child had
become altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key
which had made the ambition and the labor of her husband’s life."
1955,"There is
something even awful in the nearness it brings.
Even if we loved some
one else better than—than those we were married to, it would be no
use”—poor Dorothea, in her palpitating anxiety, could only seize her
language brokenly—“I mean, marriage drinks up all our power of giving
or getting any blessedness in that sort of love."
1956,"But at least
they had Dutch cleanliness, which makes all other inconveniences
tolerable; and the boat cushions were spread into a couch for Maggie on
the poop with all alacrity."
1957,"“‘Seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapple-gray
steed, and weareth a golden helmet?’ ‘What I see,’ answered Sancho, ‘is
nothing but a man on a gray ass like my own, who carries something
shiny on his head.’ ‘Just so,’ answered Don Quixote: ‘and that
resplendent object is the helmet of Mambrino.’”
“Sir Humphry Davy?” said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his easy smiling
way, taking up Sir James Chettam’s remark that he was studying Davy’s
Agricultural Chemistry."
1958,"Again,
the matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he
treated what to her were the most stirring thoughts, was easily
accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in
which she herself shared during their engagement."
1959,"“These
things,” he added, looking at Lydgate, “would be to me such relaxation
as tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction.”
“I confess,” said Lydgate, smiling, “amusement is rather an
unsatisfactory prescription."
1960,"There’s
Rebecca, and Joanna, and Elizabeth, you know.”
“Ay, ay, I remember—you’ll see I’ve remembered ’em all—all dark and
ugly."
1961,"Caleb Garth had
undertaken it, had failed during its progress, and before the interior
fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business;
and when referring to the Hospital he often said that however Bulstrode
might ring if you tried him, he liked good solid carpentry and masonry,
and had a notion both of drains and chimneys."
1962,"Mr. Thesiger is turned against him, and wants him
out o’ the parish."
1963,"For what were
these if not to be merry at appropriate times, interchanging visits and
poultry with due frequency, paying each other old-established
compliments in sound traditional phrases, passing well-tried personal
jokes, urging your guests to eat and drink too much out of hospitality,
and eating and drinking too much in your neighbour’s house to show that
you liked your cheer?"
1964,"“But you will have more than half an hour to yourself after I
am gone,” he added, taking out his watch."
1965,"But the people in
manufacturing towns are always disreputable.”
“You began by saying that one report was false, Mrs. Cadwallader, and I
believe this is false too,” said Dorothea, with indignant energy; “at
least, I feel sure it is a misrepresentation."
1966,"“Pretty well; I don’t care much about it,” said Philip."
1967,"And Celia the matron naturally felt more able to
advise her childless sister.
How could any one understand Dodo so well
as Celia did or love her so tenderly?"
1968,"It was not till she had passed on nearly to Tofton that she
could get the boat clear of the current."
1969,"By showing himself hopelessly
unmanageable he had made Bulstrode feel that a strong defiance was the
only resource left."
1970,"To have sought a
medical explanation for this phenomenon would have been held by Silas
himself, as well as by his minister and fellow-members, a wilful
self-exclusion from the spiritual significance that might lie therein."
1971,"Mr. Farebrother was going to walk back
to Lowick.
“Step into my carriage,” said Mr. Brooke."
1972,"Tom was
thinking of himself walking about on crutches, like the wheelwright’s
son; and Maggie, who did not guess what was in his mind, sobbed for
company."
1973,"I must wait; this life will not last
long.”
“Don’t hurry away from me without saying ‘good-by,’ Maggie,” said
Philip, as they reached the group of Scotch firs, and she continued
still to walk along without speaking."
1974,"Everybody was
well and had flannel; nobody’s pig had died; and it was Saturday
morning, when there was a general scrubbing of doors and door-stones,
and when it was useless to go into the school."
1975,"“I don’t want to wear a bonnet,” she said; “I’d rather wear a red
handkerchief, like yours” (looking at her friend by her side)."
1976,"A
man is occasionally grateful when he says ‘Thank you.’ It’s rather hard
upon him that he must use the same words with which all the world
declines a disagreeable invitation, don’t you think so, Miss Tulliver?”
“No,” said Maggie, looking at him with her direct glance; “if we use
common words on a great occasion, they are the more striking, because
they are felt at once to have a particular meaning, like old banners,
or everyday clothes, hung up in a sacred place.”
“Then my compliment ought to be eloquent,” said Stephen, really not
quite knowing what he said while Maggie looked at him, “seeing that the
words were so far beneath the occasion.”
“No compliment can be eloquent, except as an expression of
indifference,” said Maggie, flushing a little."
1977,"He should be more careful.
Mrs.
Waule has been telling uncle that Fred is very unsteady.” Mary spoke
from a girlish impulse which got the better of her judgment."
1978,"It’s all one.
I’ll tell my father everything
myself, and you may go to the devil.”
Dunsey perceived that he had overshot his mark, and that there was a
point at which even the hesitating Godfrey might be driven into
decision."
1979,"Maggie in her crude form, with her hair down
her back, and altogether in a state of dubious promise, was a most
undesirable niece; but now she was capable of being at once ornamental
and useful."
1980,"His mind was
too busy trying to give some definite bearing to Dolly’s words for him
to think of answering her."
1981,"“You’d like to see it on, sister?” she said sadly."
1982,"The tobacco trade is growing.
I should
cut my own nose off in not doing the best I could at it."
1983,"“If Henrietta Noble forms an attachment to any one, Mrs. Casaubon,”
said his mother, emphatically,—“she is like a dog—she would take their
shoes for a pillow and sleep the better.”
“Mr."
1984,"“But if
she’d just take no notice, and not call her money in; as it’s not so
much for one sister to ask of another; time ’ud mend things, and
Tulliver ’ud forget all about it, and they’d be friends again.”
Mrs Tulliver, you perceive, was not aware of her husband’s irrevocable
determination to pay in the five hundred pounds; at least such a
determination exceeded her powers of belief."
1985,"The
troubles she has had here have wearied her,” said Lydgate, breaking off
again, lest he should say too much."
1986,"Yes,
Mrs. Lydgate was at home.
“I will go in and speak to her, if she will allow me."
1987,"As Mr. Casaubon’s carriage was passing out of the gateway, it arrested
the entrance of a pony phaeton driven by a lady with a servant seated
behind."
1988,"How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage
with a husband as crown-prince by your side—himself in fact a
subject—while the captives look up forever hopeless, losing their rest
probably, and if their appetite too, so much the better!"
1989,"He forbade her
seeing you, you say; he’ll break every bone in your body, for your
greater happiness, if you don’t take care."
1990,"There was nothing to
allure her now; duty would be easy, and all the old calm purposes would
reign peacefully once more."
1991,"She was vexed and disappointed,
but she was bent on abstaining from useless words."
1992,"Something which
may be called an inward silent sob had gone on in Dorothea before she
said with a pure voice, just trembling in the last words as if only
from its liquid flexibility—
“Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say."
1993,"In fact, the world is full of hopeful
analogies and handsome dubious eggs called possibilities."
1994,"There are men who
don’t mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about."
1995,"The pride of being
ladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not
exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably “good:” if you inquired
backward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring
or parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a
clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan
gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and
managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a
respectable family estate."
1996,"If he had drawn her towards him, she would never have surveyed
him—never have said, “Is he worth living for?” but would have felt him
simply a part of her own life."
1997,"Bowyer couldn’t afford it, and only wanted
to hinder every other man from making a figure."
1998,"Moreover, the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in
the Dodson family, Martha was enjoined to have Mrs Tulliver’s room
ready an hour earlier than usual, that the laying out of the best
clothes might not be deferred till the last moment, as was sometimes
the case in families of lax views, where the ribbon-strings were never
rolled up, where there was little or no wrapping in silver paper, and
where the sense that the Sunday clothes could be got at quite easily
produced no shock to the mind."
1999,"He is likely to fly out as if
you insulted him.
Of course it is a painful affair.”
Rosamond turned her neck and patted her hair, looking the image of
placid indifference."
2000,"It was still that glorious war-time which was felt to be a peculiar
favour of Providence towards the landed interest, and the fall of
prices had not yet come to carry the race of small squires and yeomen
down that road to ruin for which extravagant habits and bad husbandry
were plentifully anointing their wheels."
2001,"“I have not taken a bribe yet.
But there is a pale shade of bribery
which is sometimes called prosperity."
2002,"Not at all: a telescope might have swept the parishes
of Tipton and Freshitt, the whole area visited by Mrs. Cadwallader in
her phaeton, without witnessing any interview that could excite
suspicion, or any scene from which she did not return with the same
unperturbed keenness of eye and the same high natural color."
2003,"“He says it has a
sort of sugared complacency and flattering make-believe in it, as if it
were written for the birthday _fête_ of a German Grand-Duke.”
“Oh, pooh!"
2004,"She received
his kiss and returned it faintly, and in this way an appearance of
accord was recovered for the time."
2005,"“You’re my elders and betters, you know; I was obliged to
come when you sent for me.”
“Why, this is what I want—and just shake yourself sober and listen,
will you?” said Godfrey, savagely."
2006,"“I beg your pardon for
unintentionally annoying you.
In fact, I should rather attribute to you
a romantic disregard of your own worldly interests."
2007,"Lydgate came home earlier than he had expected, about half-past five,
and found her there."
2008,"It was
the latter privilege for which Mr Tulliver paid a high price in Tom’s
initiatory months at King’s Lorton."
2009,"“That’s a showy sort of thing to do, you know,” said Mr. Brooke."
2010,"“I am very ignorant—you will quite wonder at my ignorance,” said
Dorothea."
2011,"Maggie had no sooner uttered this entreaty than she was wretched at the
admission it implied; but Stephen turned away at once, and following
her upward glance, he saw Philip Wakem sealed in the half-hidden
corner, so that he could command little more than that angle of the
hall in which Maggie sat."
2012,"She fixed her
eyes on Fred, saying—
“I suppose you have asked your father for the rest of the money and he
has refused you.”
“No,” said Fred, biting his lip, and speaking with more difficulty;
“but I know it will be of no use to ask him; and unless it were of use,
I should not like to mention Mr. Garth’s name in the matter.”
“It has come at an unfortunate time,” said Caleb, in his hesitating
way, looking down at the notes and nervously fingering the paper,
“Christmas upon us—I’m rather hard up just now."
2013,"For I’n niver
forgot how you looked when you fretted about the books bein’ gone; it’s
stuck by me as if it was a pictur hingin’ before me."
2014,"He seemed to weave, like the spider, from pure impulse, without
reflection."
2015,"“No, I sha’n’t take it; you give it me.”
Bob took the halfpenny out of his pocket, and threw it away from him on
the ground."
2016,"But I think you ought to have told me before
we were married that you would place me in the worst position, rather
than give up your own will.”
Lydgate did not speak, but tossed his head on one side, and twitched
the corners of his mouth in despair."
2017,"“It’s yeads,” said Bob, hastily, snatching up the halfpenny as it fell."
2018,"Mr. Peacock had.
You
should be more careful not to offend people, and you should send out
medicines as the others do."
2019,"In the night he had debated whether he should
not get on the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note
to Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat."
2020,"“The rain is quite over now.
I told Mr.
Brooke not to call for me: I would rather walk the five miles."
2021,"The strength of that passion had been a power enabling
him to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it."
2022,"It spoils my enjoyment
of anything when I am made to think that most people are shut out from
it.”
“I call that the fanaticism of sympathy,” said Will, impetuously."
2023,"“My dear Dorothea—‘who with repentance is not satisfied, is not of
heaven nor earth:’—you do not think me worthy to be banished by that
severe sentence,” said Mr. Casaubon, exerting himself to make a strong
statement, and also to smile faintly."
2024,"Mr. Farebrother would believe me, and my uncle, and Sir James
Chettam."
2025,"You take money
like a lord; I suppose you lose it like one.”
“I thought I was not to look a gift-horse in the mouth, sir."
2026,"I want to do
my duty.”
It would be difficult to say whether it were Silas or Eppie that was
more deeply stirred by this last speech of Godfrey’s."
2027,"“But I’m afraid o’ neither man nor ghost, and
I’m ready to lay a fair bet."
2028,"And you’ll have
less pleasure in pulling the house over my head, when your own skull’s
to be broken too.”
“Aye, aye,” said Dunstan, rising; “all right."
2029,"“As if I shouldn’t feel what happened to you—just the same,” she said,
with reproach of another kind,—the reproach of love, asking for more
trust."
2030,"“Well, you know, Chettam, I couldn’t help Casaubon’s will: it was a
sort of will to make things worse.”
“Exactly,” said Sir James, hastily."
2031,"“Aye, and a partic’lar thing happened, didn’t it, Mr. Macey, so as you
were likely to remember that marriage?” said the landlord, in a
congratulatory tone."
2032,"Presently, however, she came full on Mrs and Miss Turnbull, old
acquaintances of her family; they both looked at her strangely, and
turned a little aside without speaking."
2033,"But
there was a branch house at the west end, and no pettiness or dinginess
to give suggestions of shame."
2034,"“I
should not give up to James when I knew he was wrong, as you used to do
to Mr. Casaubon.”
CHAPTER LXXIII."
2035,"I have an objection.
I am by no means sure that your son,
in his recklessness and ignorance—I will use no severer word—has not
tried to raise money by holding out his future prospects, or even that
some one may not have been foolish enough to supply him on so vague a
presumption: there is plenty of such lax money-lending as of other
folly in the world.”
“But Fred gives me his honor that he has never borrowed money on the
pretence of any understanding about his uncle’s land."
2036,"I’ll come
down to the lower window.”
“Alone, Maggie?” said Tom, in a voice of deep astonishment, as he
opened the middle window, on a level with the boat."
2037,"Stephen was too well bred not to seem unaware that the previous
conversation could have been felt embarrassing, and at once began to
talk of impersonal matters, asking Lucy if she knew when the bazaar was
at length to take place, so that there might be some hope of seeing her
rain the influence of her eyes on objects more grateful than those
worsted flowers that were growing under her fingers."
2038,"Fred’s mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which even his
ready hopefulness could not immediately quell."
2039,"Nevertheless before the evening was at an end she was very happy.
In an
hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mr. Casaubon she talked to him with more
freedom than she had ever felt before, even pouring out her joy at the
thought of devoting herself to him, and of learning how she might best
share and further all his great ends."
2040,"She did not _read_ the letter: she heard him uttering it, and the
voice shook her with its old strange power."
2041,"The truth is,
he knew nothing of this man Raffles, or that there were any bad secrets
about him; and he thought that Mr. Bulstrode offered him the money
because he repented, out of kindness, of having refused it before."
2042,"The rain
had washed away all possibility of distinguishing foot-marks, but a
close investigation of the spot had disclosed, in the direction
opposite to the village, a tinder-box, with a flint and steel, half
sunk in the mud."
2043,"I have not marked any of
the jewellery.” Lydgate had really felt this point of the jewellery
very bitter to himself; but he had overcome the feeling by severe
argument."
2044,"It is a very inconvenient fault of
mine.”
“It must be very stupid to be always in a girls’ school,” said Alfred."
2045,"They say he cures
every one.”
Mrs. Vincy sprang to the window and opened it in an instant, thinking
only of Fred and not of medical etiquette."
2046,"It is not wearisome to you, I
trust, Dorothea?”
“I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,” said Dorothea,
who told the simple truth; for what she dreaded was to exert herself in
reading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever."
2047,"There was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him."
2048,"In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."""
2049,"Sir Thomas’s look
implied, “On your judgment, Edmund, I depended; what have you been
about?” She knelt in spirit to her uncle, and her bosom swelled to
utter, “Oh, not to _him_!"
2050,"“If I had not been active,” said she, “and made a point of being
introduced to his mother, and then prevailed on my sister to pay the
first visit, I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come
of it; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who
wants a great deal of encouragement, and there were girls enough on the
catch for him if we had been idle."
2051,"It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
     ""Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you."
2052,"After the first perturbation
of surprise had passed away, in a “Good heaven!"
2053,"She was then but
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
     herself."
2054,"What happiness if the door should not be locked!
but of course it is;
for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go
where they like.”
The door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were all agreed in
turning joyfully through it, and leaving the unmitigated glare of day
behind."
2055,"That is exactly he.
I have not forgot your
description of Mr. Tilney—‘a brown skin, with dark eyes, and rather
dark hair.’ Well, my taste is different."
2056,"Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs."
2057,"Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire."
2058,"Returning in
silence to his seat, therefore, he remained for some minutes most
civilly answering all Mrs. Morland’s common remarks about the weather
and roads."
2059,"I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton
another year.
Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public
blessing; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth’s wife must be to
fill her house, and give the best balls in the country.”
Fanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness, till
suddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes, she exclaimed, “Ah!"
2060,"The liberty which her
imagination had dared to take with the character of his father—could he
ever forgive it?"
2061,"She gave
advice, advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding, and
given so mildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect
temper, and she had the happiness of observing its good effects not
unfrequently."
2062,"The idea that
returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford, after proving herself
cooled and staggered by a return to London habits, would yet prove
herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up."
2063,"If they profess a disinclination for
it, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.”
Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no
disinclination to the state herself."
2064,"Then let us walk about and quiz people.
Come along with
me, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two
younger sisters and their partners."
2065,"Everybody is taken in at some period or other.”
“Not always in marriage, dear Mary.”
“In marriage especially."
2066,"A little flogging for man and woman too
would be the best way of preventing such things.”
Fanny read to herself that “it was with infinite concern the newspaper
had to announce to the world a matrimonial _fracas_ in the family of
Mr. R. of Wimpole Street; the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not
long been enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised to
become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world, having quitted
her husband’s roof in company with the well-known and captivating Mr.
C., the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known
even to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone.”
“It is a mistake, sir,” said Fanny instantly; “it must be a mistake, it
cannot be true; it must mean some other people.”
She spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame; she spoke with a
resolution which sprung from despair, for she spoke what she did not,
could not believe herself."
2067,"She wished to be able
to decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made
it easier to swallow than to speak."
2068,"She worked very
diligently under her aunt’s directions, but her diligence and her
silence concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon she made
her escape with her work to the East room, that she might have no
concern in another, and, as she deemed it, most unnecessary rehearsal
of the first act, which Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous at
once of having her time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr.
Rushworth."
2069,"Catherine’s feelings, as she got into the carriage, were in a very
unsettled state; divided between regret for the loss of one great
pleasure, and the hope of soon enjoying another, almost its equal in
degree, however unlike in kind."
2070,"""But,"" he added, ""you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."""
2071,"Guess my surprise,
when I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable, most
impossible thing in the world; had offended all the farmers, all the
labourers, all the hay in the parish!"
2072,"Heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"""
2073,"""But I can assure you,"" she added, ""that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing."
2074,"It was to this effect:
     ""Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well."
2075,"The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner."
2076,"To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia."
2077,"He must tell his own story.”
“But he will tell only half of it.”
“A quarter would be enough.”
A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney."
2078,"I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
     various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with
     assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself."
2079,"A
famous clever animal for the road—only forty guineas.
I had fifty minds
to buy it myself, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse
when I meet with one; but it would not answer my purpose, it would not
do for the field."
2080,"are not you wild to know?”
“Oh!
yes, quite; what can it be?"
2081,"To the General, of course, he would not dare to speak; but to
Eleanor—what might he not say to Eleanor about her?"
2082,"You have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him."
2083,"My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.
My temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."""
2084,"I am sorry it happens
so, for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people; and
you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella."
2085,"Yes;
I think it must be compliments.
Is not there a something wanted, Miss
Price, in our language—a something between compliments and—and love—to
suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together?"
2086,"A day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for the Crawfords’
departure; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more
effort for the young man before he left Mansfield, that all his
professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to
sustain them as possible."
2087,"The scheme advanced.
Opposition was vain; and as to Mrs. Norris, he was
mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any."
2088,"It does him the highest
honour; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic
happiness and pure attachment."
2089,"You know the
ease and the pleasure with which this would be done.
You know all that
would be felt on the occasion.”
Fanny thanked him, but tried to laugh it off."
2090,"I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles."
2091,"It is a _very_ anxious period for her.”
As he said this, each looked towards their mother."
2092,"In
your bedchamber I know you _cannot_ have a fire.
Here is some great
misapprehension which must be rectified."
2093,"He wrote with his own hand his
love to his cousin William, and sent him half a guinea under the seal."
2094,"You will
be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will not
refuse to visit me in prison?"
2095,"A face once taken was taken for
generations.
But here she was obliged to look and consider and study
for a likeness."
2096,"Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham's attentions."
2097,"“If poor Sir Thomas were fated never
to return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria
well married,” she very often thought; always when they were in the
company of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a
young man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and
finest places in the country."
2098,"She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did."
2099,"I hate such greediness—so good
as your father is to the family, employing the man all the year round!”
Nobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; and
Edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his
only satisfaction."
2100,"The domestic, unpretending merits of a
person never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating
tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours."
2101,"It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady’s
exact estimate of her own perfections."
2102,"""How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."""
2103,"Mrs. Norris and her nieces
were all well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and
agreed to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies
did not forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly
have answered for his being so, they would neither authorise the
liberty nor run the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr.
Rushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to
walk down to the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and
inquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not."
2104,"But now every commendation on every subject is comprised
in that one word.”
“While, in fact,” cried his sister, “it ought only to be applied to
you, without any commendation at all."
2105,"I have not lost a moment, however.
The
post was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment’s
delay."
2106,"Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."""
2107,"At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,
""Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."""
2108,"My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think."
2109,"“Return the necklace!
No, my dear Fanny, upon no account."
2110,"This indulgence, though
not more than Catherine had hoped for, completed her conviction of
being favoured beyond every other human creature, in friends and
fortune, circumstance and chance."
2111,"Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began."
2112,"They sat without a fire; but
that was a privation familiar even to Fanny, and she suffered the less
because reminded by it of the East room."
2113,"The thought returned again and again.
“Oh for
the Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with.” Each sister
could echo the wish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of
his gratifications it was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at
the idea."
2114,"There is
one point, on which I want your advice.
I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham's character."""
2115,"How can they suit each other?--Do you
know Mr.
""Not at all."""
2116,"The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--Do you draw?"""
2117,"A civil servant she had withstood; but when Dr. Grant
himself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to
be very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible;
and to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal
rain in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all
her plan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a
single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the
sound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price
dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful."
2118,"While they snugly repair to their own end
of the house, she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient
housekeeper, up a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages,
into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about
twenty years before."
2119,"It was over, and she had escaped without reproaches and without
detection.
Her secret was still her own; and while that was the case,
she thought she could resign herself to almost everything."
2120,"“Indeed, Morland, I must drive you away.
Consider how
far you have to ride."
2121,"But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not."
2122,"It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy."
2123,"Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and
your teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes."
2124,"Mr. Rushworth was worked on.
“Well,” said he, “if you really
think I had better go: it would be foolish to bring the key for
nothing.” And letting himself out, he walked off without farther
ceremony."
2125,"That,
however, in so modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence;
and chusing at least to appear satisfied, he quickly added, “No, no, I
know _that_ is quite out of the question; quite impossible."
2126,"But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure."
2127,"Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended
compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she felt only one
thing; and her eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could
yet be brighter, she exclaimed with eager pleasure, “Did he?"
2128,"But Mr. Gardiner
     could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning."
2129,"It was some months before Sir Thomas’s consent could be received; but,
in the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure
in the connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried on
without restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs.
Norris’s talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at
present."
2130,"He was in high spirits, doing everything with happy ease, and
preeminent in all the lively turns, quick resources, and playful
impudence that could do honour to the game; and the round table was
altogether a very comfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and
orderly silence of the other."
2131,"We will go round the Park every day.
I am the happiest creature in
     the world."
2132,"But I, who live in a small retired
village in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a place
as this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, a
variety of things to be seen and done all day long, which I can know
nothing of there.”
“You are not fond of the country.”
“Yes, I am."
2133,"No
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind."
2134,"In one respect she was admirably fitted
to introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going
everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be."
2135,"They were so fully convinced, however, that their brother would not
have the courage to apply in person for his father’s consent, and so
repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely
to come to Northanger than at the present time, that she suffered her
mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her
own."
2136,"Catherine had seen nothing to
compare with it; and her feelings of delight were so strong, that
without waiting for any better authority, she boldly burst forth in
wonder and praise."
2137,"“Of course,”
continued her uncle, “it cannot be supposed but that he should request
to speak with you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too
natural, a claim too just to be denied."
2138,"I think if we had had the disposal
of events—if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just
for a week or two, about the equinox, there would have been a
difference."
2139,"“You know nothing and you care less, as people say.
Never did tone
express indifference plainer."
2140,"I _do_ remember now being with you, and
seeing him as well as the rest—but that we were ever alone for five
minutes— However, it is not worth arguing about, for whatever might pass
on his side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection of it,
that I never thought, nor expected, nor wished for anything of the kind
from him."
2141,"""I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,"" said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak."
2142,"“It is not at all what I like,” he continued.
“No man can like being
driven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency."
2143,"To such
anxious attention was the General’s civility carried, that not aware of
her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he was quite angry
with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the
apartment herself."
2144,"Elizabeth almost stared at her.--""Can this be Mr.
""His father was an excellent man,"" said Mrs. Gardiner."
2145,"However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer."
2146,"It takes me quite unawares.
And now
you must be off for Spithead too."
2147,"Her father read his
newspaper, and her mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual,
while the tea was in preparation, and wished Rebecca would mend it; and
Fanny was first roused by his calling out to her, after humphing and
considering over a particular paragraph: “What’s the name of your great
cousins in town, Fan?”
A moment’s recollection enabled her to say, “Rushworth, sir.”
“And don’t they live in Wimpole Street?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Then, there’s the devil to pay among them, that’s all!"
2148,"She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family."
2149,"Let us drop
the subject.”
Catherine, in some amazement, complied, and after remaining a few
moments silent, was on the point of reverting to what interested her at
that time rather more than anything else in the world, Laurentina’s
skeleton, when her friend prevented her, by saying, “For heaven’s sake!"
2150,"They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain."
2151,"I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on
his side.”
“She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of
you,” said Fanny, with half a sigh, “to have any such apprehension."
2152,"But gracious me!
I quite forgot!
I ought not to have said a word about it."
2153,"Not considering in how different a circle
she had been just seeing him, nor how much might be owing to contrast,
she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and
regardful of others than formerly."
2154,"It was very noble—very grand—very charming!—was all that
Catherine had to say, for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned
the colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praise that
had much meaning, was supplied by the General: the costliness or
elegance of any room’s fitting-up could be nothing to her; she cared
for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century."
2155,"She must have
been a happy creature in spite of all that she felt, or thought she
felt, for the distress of those around her."
2156,"I really could not face my
acquaintance if I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the
country, it would be taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me,
Miss Morland, never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small
sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it."
2157,"It
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it."
2158,"This acting
scheme gets worse and worse, you see.
They have chosen almost as bad a
play as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask
the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us."
2159,"It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came
in, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially
agreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the
object of the day."
2160,"The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together."
2161,"“To be
justified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty
of any provision.”
“What!"
2162,"There was neither health nor gaiety in
sunshine in a town.
She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloud
of moving dust, and her eyes could only wander from the walls, marked
by her father’s head, to the table cut and notched by her brothers,
where stood the tea-board never thoroughly cleaned, the cups and
saucers wiped in streaks, the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin
blue, and the bread and butter growing every minute more greasy than
even Rebecca’s hands had first produced it."
2163,"She says there was
hardly any veal to be got at market this morning, it is so uncommonly
scarce.”
“Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance?”
“Yes; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs.
Hughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her.”
“Did you indeed?"
2164,"“Poor dears!
how tired you must both be!
and now, what will you have?"
2165,"I felt so sure of his being quite gone away.”
“When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before, he was in Bath but
for a couple of days."
2166,"It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all."
2167,"yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again."
2168,"Of various admirals I could
tell you a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of
their pay, and their bickerings and jealousies."
2169,"I am never to see my cards; and Mr. Crawford does
all the rest.”
“Bertram,” said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the opportunity
of a little languor in the game, “I have never told you what happened
to me yesterday in my ride home.” They had been hunting together, and
were in the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield,
when his horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had
been obliged to give up, and make the best of his way back."
2170,"""She seems a very pleasant young woman,"" said Bingley.
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain."
2171,"At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself."
2172,"It was
much pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father; and to
think of their father in England again within a certain period, which
these letters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise."
2173,"Mr. Rushworth, however, though not
usually a great talker, had still more to say on the subject next his
heart."
2174,"""And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"""
2175,"how shall I bear so much happiness!""
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty."
2176,"Mr. Yates was
particularly pleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron
at Ecclesford, had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw’s, and been
forced to re-rant it all in his own room."
2177,"""Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks."
2178,"It will be the last
time, you know; the last morning.”
“You had better not."
2179,"""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" replied his wife, ""how can you be so tiresome!"
2180,"By this time she is
actually with them!
If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy!"
2181,"Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more."""
2182,"""I confess,"" said he, ""that I should not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings."
2183,"I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable."
2184,"It was
of gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a
longer and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped,
in fixing on this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to
keep."
2185,"The place deserves it, and you will
find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of."
2186,"I am sure it will be all hushed up,
and nothing proved but Rushworth’s folly."
2187,"In having this cause of
uneasiness so pleasantly removed, the force of the other was likewise
weakened."
2188,"Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying."
2189,"They left England with
the probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent.
The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of its
utility to his son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the
rest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction of
others at their present most interesting time of life."
2190,"I am not qualified to form one.
I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge."
2191,"""Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,"" she added in a melancholy tone,
""for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."""
2192,"""How hard it is in some cases to be believed!""
""And how impossible in others!"""
2193,"As a daughter, he hoped a penitent one, she should be
protected by him, and secured in every comfort, and supported by every
encouragement to do right, which their relative situations admitted;
but farther than _that_ he could not go."
2194,"But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture."
2195,"She was deep in other musing.
The remembrance of her first evening in
that room, of her father and his newspaper, came across her."
2196,"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted."
2197,"But he was master at Mansfield Park.
When he had really resolved on any
measure, he could always carry it through; and now by dint of long
talking on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny’s
sometimes seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go;
obtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction, for Lady
Bertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought
Fanny ought to go, and therefore that she must."
2198,"CHAPTER IX
Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady; and the whole
party were welcomed by him with due attention."
2199,"Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire."
2200,"In that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction."
2201,"“They do not want me at all,” said she, seating herself."
2202,"""Dining out,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""that is very unlucky."""
2203,"Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.
He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily."
2204,"My
cousin is grown up.
She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs
and not outs are beyond me.”
“And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained."
2205,"Edmund watched the progress of her attention, and was amused and
gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework,
which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally: how it fell from
her hand while she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes
which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were
turned and fixed on Crawford—fixed on him for minutes, fixed on him, in
short, till the attraction drew Crawford’s upon her, and the book was
closed, and the charm was broken."
2206,"One came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty."
2207,"“Miss Bertram thought you would follow her.”
“I should not have had to follow her if she had staid.”
This could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced."
2208,"to
put me on my guard?
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"""
2209,"“Well,” said Miss Crawford, “and do you not scold us for our
imprudence?"
2210,"""I should not mind any thing at all.""
""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."""
2211,"Being no longer able,
however, to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects, she soon
began to walk with lassitude; the General perceived it, and with a
concern for her health, which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of
him, was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house."
2212,"It was no wonder that the General should
shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain; a room
in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had
passed, which released his suffering wife, and left him to the stings
of conscience."
2213,"Far be it from me,"" he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, ""to resent the behaviour of your daughter."
2214,"If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."""
2215,"no smile, no continued
observance attended it; his eyes were immediately returned to their
former direction."
2216,"Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you
     will drink to our good journey."
2217,"Tragedy may be your
choice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_."
2218,"She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so
sweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she loved."
2219,"Yes, dear old grey pony!
cousin, when I remember how
much I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talked
of as likely to do me good (oh!"
2220,"I have a
notion you danced with him, but am not quite sure."
2221,"Their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them."
2222,"Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."""
2223,"Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly."
2224,"From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him."
2225,"Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see."
2226,"She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power."
2227,"Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."""
2228,"He remained with them some time, and was only too agreeable for
Catherine to be contented when he went away."
2229,"Not all her precautions, however, could save her from
being suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display of
the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose
it really intended for Fanny."
2230,"I hope I shall have some good friend to help me.”
“Your best friend upon such an occasion,” said Miss Bertram calmly,
“would be Mr. Repton, I imagine.”
“That is what I was thinking of."
2231,"Such a
    contrast between him and your brother!
pray send me some news of
    the latter—I am quite unhappy about him; he seemed so uncomfortable
    when he went away, with a cold, or something that affected his
    spirits."
2232,"She is also very hardy herself, which of course will
influence her in her opinion of the wants of others."
2233,"She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night."
2234,"And as to _most
matters_, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mind
about.”
“By Jove, no more do I."
2235,"Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, “I take the part
which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and” (with a bolder eye) “Miss
Crawford is to be Amelia.”
“I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled
up, with _us_,” replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat his
mother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great
vexation."
2236,"Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, ""_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment."
2237,"Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcely
comprehend to have been possible."
2238,"_He_ was released from
the engagement to be mortified and unhappy, till some other pretty girl
could attract him into matrimony again, and he might set forward on a
second, and, it is to be hoped, more prosperous trial of the state: if
duped, to be duped at least with good humour and good luck; while she
must withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings to a retirement and
reproach which could allow no second spring of hope or character."
2239,"""I can readily believe,"" answered he gravely, ""that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."""
2240,"Mr. Rushworth is never remiss.
But dear
Maria has such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true
delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth—that wish
of avoiding particularity!"
2241,"Sir Thomas promised that it should be so.
Edmund’s account of Fanny’s
disposition he could believe to be just; he supposed she had all those
feelings, but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _had_;
for, less willing than his son to trust to the future, he could not
help fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were
necessary for her, she might not have persuaded herself into receiving
his addresses properly before the young man’s inclination for paying
them were over."
2242,"Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do."
2243,"""Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses.
He does not
want abilities."
2244,"It would
be hideous to be always together; we should be the jest of the place."
2245,"There I build my confidence.
By that right I do and will
deserve you; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I
declare it, I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes."
2246,"“Bertram,” said Henry Crawford, “I shall make a point of coming to
Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon."
2247,"But he found Lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.
She cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham."
2248,"I must show it you some day or other.
Bath
is a nice place, Catherine, after all."
2249,"It is a family living, Miss Morland; and the
property in the place being chiefly my own, you may believe I take care
that it shall not be a bad one."
2250,"""My dear, dear Lydia!""
she cried: ""This is delightful indeed!--She will
be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My
good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage
every thing."
2251,"sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not one of those who
can talk and work at the same time."
2252,"how I have trembled at my uncle’s
opening his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind
pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince
me that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right you
proved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.”
“And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as
good for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for
your ultimate happiness too.”
So ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it
could render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had
not the smallest intention of taking her."
2253,"There she
fell miserably short of the true heroic height.
At present she did not
know her own poverty, for she had no lover to portray."
2254,"Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways.”
“I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them.”
“No doubt; but that is no explanation of the present.”
“What am I to do?”
“You know what you ought to do."
2255,"The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."""
2256,"Bertram,” said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards, “you know
Henry to be such a capital improver, that you cannot possibly engage in
anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help."
2257,"No, no.
You ought to be satisfied with her two
cousins.”
“But I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a small
hole in Fanny Price’s heart."
2258,"It only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."""
2259,"I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured and
pleasant in his own family, and I do not think him so very ill-looking
as I did—at least, one sees many worse."
2260,"""If I,"" said Mr. Collins, ""were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to."
2261,"Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs."
2262,"I am not satisfied about Maddison.
I am
sure he still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of
his own into a certain mill, which I design for somebody else."
2263,"While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them."
2264,"But I
am sure she cannot mean to torment, for she is very much attached to my
brother."
2265,"We must not make him desperate.""
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation."
2266,"Mr. Bingley arrived.
Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could."
2267,"Everything seemed to cooperate for
her advantage.
By the kindness of her first friends, the Allens, she
had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met
her."
2268,"“Lovers’ Vows
were at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother
by themselves."
2269,"But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever he
made his application, would give his father any just idea of Isabella’s
conduct, it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay
the whole business before him as it really was, enabling the General by
that means to form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare his
objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations."
2270,"Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance."
2271,"I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage.
Is it true?"""
2272,"I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way."
2273,"A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter."
2274,"But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came."
2275,"She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,
""Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together."""
2276,"The kindness, the earnestness of Eleanor’s manner in pressing
her to stay, and Henry’s gratified look on being told that her stay was
determined, were such sweet proofs of her importance with them, as left
her only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do
comfortably without."
2277,"To be
distinguished for elegance and accomplishments, the authorised object
of their youth, could have had no useful influence that way, no moral
effect on the mind."
2278,"How well she walks!
and how readily
she falls in with the inclination of others!"
2279,"His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes."
2280,"He was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which, operating
on an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than delicacy, made her
affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, and
determined him to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing
her to love him."
2281,"""He is certainly a good brother,"" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows."
2282,"This cannot have taken you by surprise.
You must have observed
his attentions; and though you always received them very properly (I
have no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them to be
unpleasant to you."
2283,"""My fingers,"" said Elizabeth, ""do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women's do."
2284,"Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words ""apology,""
""Hunsford,"" and ""Lady Catherine de Bourgh."""
2285,"The General’s improving hand had
not loitered here: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of
the cooks had been adopted within this, their spacious theatre; and,
when the genius of others had failed, his own had often produced the
perfection wanted."
2286,"It is
generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price
has found it so, though she did not know it.”
“I shall soon be rested,” said Fanny; “to sit in the shade on a fine
day, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.”
After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again."
2287,"Will twenty minutes after four suit you?”
“Yes, sir,” was Fanny’s humble answer, given with the feelings almost
of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris; and not bearing to remain with her
in what might seem a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of
the room, having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words
spoken in angry agitation—
“Quite unnecessary!"
2288,"Put them next to your great uncle
the judge.
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines."
2289,"But, Fanny,” stopping her, by
taking her hand, and speaking low and seriously, “you know what all
this means."
2290,"""There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law."
2291,"There is nothing more to be said or done.
From this hour the
subject is never to be revived between us."
2292,"Time
would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings, but still it was a
sort of thing which he never could get entirely the better of; and as
to his ever meeting with any other woman who could—it was too
impossible to be named but with indignation."
2293,"They cannot be traced.
You may not have heard of the last
blow—Julia’s elopement; she is gone to Scotland with Yates."
2294,"On the morrow they were walking about together with true
enjoyment, and every succeeding morrow renewed a _tête-à-tête_ which
Sir Thomas could not but observe with complacency, even before Edmund
had pointed it out to him."
2295,"And did they speak to you?”
“Yes, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour."
2296,"Yet the General would not enter it.” Miss Tilney continuing silent, she
ventured to say, “Her death must have been a great affliction!”
“A great and increasing one,” replied the other, in a low voice."
2297,"""No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."""
2298,"Catherine, though she could not
help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse, he should
think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks,
congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent
a coachman; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the
same quiet manner, without showing the smallest propensity towards any
unpleasant vivacity, and (considering its inevitable pace was ten miles
an hour) by no means alarmingly fast, gave herself up to all the
enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine
mild day of February, with the consciousness of safety."
2299,"If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the
poor basket."
2300,"Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.
In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go."
2301,"You know I told you not to touch it, because Susan is so
cross about it."
2302,"Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home."
2303,"He has
children of his own, and may have more.
How could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"""
2304,"""And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"""
2305,"Her
manner was incurably gentle; and she was not aware how much it
concealed the sternness of her purpose."
2306,"In proof, he repeats, and more eagerly, what he said at
Portsmouth about our conveying you home, and I join him in it with all
my soul."
2307,"Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
""Aye, there she comes,"" continued Mrs. Bennet, ""looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word."
2308,"I cannot
     understand it.
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this."
2309,"Its being a gift of my brother’s
need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it, as I assure
you it makes none in my willingness to part with it."
2310,"She was nearly fainting: all her
former habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it
compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the
development before him, with solicitude on Edmund’s account
indescribable."
2311,"I congratulate her.
Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then."
2312,"can it be really so!
Yet now I must believe you,"" cried
Jane."
2313,"Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on
this point: she did not know how either to wear the cross, or to
refrain from wearing it."
2314,"""You are over scrupulous surely.
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."""
2315,"“No, no, Julia must not be Amelia.
It is not at all the part for her."
2316,"""But surely,"" said she, ""I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."""
2317,"But no
such recollection befriended her.
She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess."
2318,"In a house so furnished, and so guarded, she
could have nothing to explore or to suffer, and might go to her bedroom
as securely as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton."
2319,"In the absence of Jane,
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief."
2320,"Being the
only young person at home, I consider _you_ as the greatest sufferer."
2321,"Where?”
“On the right-hand pavement—she must be almost out of sight now.”
Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother’s
arm, walking slowly down the street."
2322,"Her reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hoped for,
had he expected to see her."
2323,"“Sir
Thomas, who had done so much for her and her brothers, and who was gone
perhaps never to return!"
2324,"Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that
was endured by the rest, by the right of a disposition which not even
innocence could keep from suffering."
2325,"He observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it ""was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;"" and, before she could reply, he added, ""It
is above eight months."
2326,"Fanny found that it was not to be, and in the
modesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable
in expecting it."
2327,"He thought of his own four
children, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc."
2328,"But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you
can and will decide for yourself, without any consideration or
deference for those who have surely some right to guide you, without
even asking their advice."
2329,"Her
explanation, defective only in being—from her irritation of nerves and
shortness of breath—no explanation at all, was instantly given."
2330,"I.
London:
Printed for T. Egerton,
Military Library, Whitehall.
[Illustration: Morning Dress."
2331,"What a strange,
unaccountable character!—for with all these symptoms of profligacy at
ten years old, she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom
stubborn, scarcely ever quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones,
with few interruptions of tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild,
hated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the
world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house."
2332,"Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect."
2333,"Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always
forget to have mine filled.”
“She has got it,” said Lady Bertram; “she has had it ever since she
came back from your house the second time.”
“What!” cried Edmund; “has she been walking as well as cutting roses;
walking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma’am?"
2334,"And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to
discover it!"
2335,"Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed,” said the gentle Mrs.
Thorpe, looking anxiously at her daughter."
2336,"He inquired next
after her family, especially William: and his kindness altogether was
such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and
thinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift
her eyes to his face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the
burnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender
feeling was increased, and she was miserable in considering how much
unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him."
2337,"By G—, I
wish you may!
But old Scholey was saying, just now, that he thought you
would be sent first to the Texel."
2338,"No one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home."
2339,"Selfishness must always be forgiven,
you know, because there is no hope of a cure.”
Fanny’s answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his conviction
that she could be in no hurry."
2340,"It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations."
2341,"But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself."
2342,"You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.
But who was your mother?
Who
are your uncles and aunts?"
2343,"""I wish it may.""
""But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model."
2344,"It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her
sister in vain."
2345,"Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began."
2346,"I depend on you for that.""
To these high
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his."
2347,"“Your father’s return will be a very interesting event.”
“It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but
including so many dangers.”
“It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your
sister’s marriage, and your taking orders.”
“Yes.”
“Don’t be affronted,” said she, laughing, “but it does put me in mind
of some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits
in a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe
return.”
“There is no sacrifice in the case,” replied Edmund, with a serious
smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; “it is entirely her own
doing.”
“Oh yes I know it is."
2348,"She felt
that she had arranged everything extremely well, and that any
alteration must be for the worse."
2349,"""I did not know before,"" continued Bingley immediately, ""that you were a
studier of character."
2350,"Her mother was a woman of useful
plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a
good constitution."
2351,"But his intention, the kindness of his intention, was thankfully
acknowledged: quite thankfully and warmly, for she was elevated beyond
the common timidity of her mind by the flow of her love for William."
2352,"Why did
she draw back and look so grave at me?
I could hardly get her to speak."
2353,"He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce."
2354,"The word ‘nicest,’ as you used it, did not
suit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shall
be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way.”
“I am sure,” cried Catherine, “I did not mean to say anything wrong;
but it _is_ a nice book, and why should not I call it so?”
“Very true,” said Henry, “and this is a very nice day, and we are
taking a very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies."
2355,"As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house."
2356,"Then shewing
her purchases: ""Look here, I have bought this bonnet."
2357,"dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.
Such a disappointment!"
2358,"But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself."""
2359,"Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself."
2360,"Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card."
2361,"Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them."
2362,"She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, ""When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."""
2363,"He had
already ate, and declined staying for their meal.
He would walk round
the ramparts, and join them with the carriage."
2364,"What
     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again
     to-morrow evening."
2365,"As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to."
2366,"She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with."
2367,"Edmund smiled and shook his head.
“By Jove!
this won’t do,” cried Tom, throwing himself into a chair with
a hearty laugh."
2368,"Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill."
2369,"Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress."
2370,"""His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,"" said
Elizabeth angrily; ""for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself."""
2371,"Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others."
2372,"On the beginning of the fifth, however, the
sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the
opposite box, recalled her to anxiety and distress."
2373,"While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road."
2374,"To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting."
2375,"How does Lord Macartney go on?”—opening a volume on
the table and then taking up some others."
2376,"In the king’s service, of course?”
Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story, but his determined
silence obliged her to relate her brother’s situation: her voice was
animated in speaking of his profession, and the foreign stations he had
been on; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been
absent without tears in her eyes."
2377,"""Obstinate, headstrong girl!
I am ashamed of you!
Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?"
2378,"Only tell me if I
was wrong.
I want to be set right."
2379,"She had not been
withstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted
merely her own gratification; _that_ might have been ensured in some
degree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she had
attended to what was due to others, and to her own character in their
opinion."
2380,"She could not respect her parents as she had hoped.
On her
father, her confidence had not been sanguine, but he was more negligent
of his family, his habits were worse, and his manners coarser, than she
had been prepared for."
2381,"""Very true; and if I had my will, we should.
But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off."
2382,"But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room."
2383,"It was all wretchedness
together.
In about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned; she was almost ready
to faint at the sight of him."
2384,"With such a regard for her, indeed, as his had long been, a regard
founded on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness, and
completed by every recommendation of growing worth, what could be more
natural than the change?"
2385,"unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated,
demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as
conscience must forbid."
2386,"Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster.
Whatever
cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces,
she had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper,
after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken
her to the dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the
receipt for a famous cream cheese; and since Julia’s leaving them they
had been met by the gardener, with whom she had made a most
satisfactory acquaintance, for she had set him right as to his
grandson’s illness, convinced him that it was an ague, and promised him
a charm for it; and he, in return, had shewn her all his choicest
nursery of plants, and actually presented her with a very curious
specimen of heath."
2387,"She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them
directly upon the General; and in spite of all her virtuous
indignation, she found herself again obliged to walk with him, listen
to him, and even to smile when he smiled."
2388,"Your lap seems full of good things,
and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my
elbow unmercifully.”
“My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old
gardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it
in my lap directly."
2389,"It was then disclosed in the following
manner.
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,
""I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy."""
2390,"Afterwards
    he got worse, and became quite my shadow.
Many girls might have
    been taken in, for never were such attentions; but I knew the
    fickle sex too well."
2391,"""What could he mean?
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning""--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?"
2392,"Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is
meant as any particular compliment to _you_; the compliment is intended
to your uncle and aunt and me."
2393,"His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing."
2394,"there was not a single point in which we
differed; I would not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly
thing, I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about
it.”
“No, indeed I should not.”
“Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than you know yourself."
2395,"But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."""
2396,"Mr. Rushworth had set
off early with the great news for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped
for such an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him the trouble
of ever coming back again."
2397,"They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family."
2398,"Eleanor, I suppose,
has talked of her a great deal?”
“Yes, a great deal."
2399,"Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."""
2400,"But the charm is broken.
My eyes are opened.”
“Cruel!” said Fanny, “quite cruel."
2401,"Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes."
2402,"She
could not but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved
him the trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and
becoming in a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford, with
all his boasted good-nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew
nothing of the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of
Edmund."
2403,"“I am no novel-reader—I seldom look into novels—Do not imagine that _I_
often read novels—It is really very well for a novel.” Such is the
common cant."
2404,"Direct to me at Lord Longtown’s, and, I must ask it, under
cover to Alice.”
“No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me, I am
sure I had better not write."
2405,"He was to be describing and recommending
matrimony to me.
I think I see him now, trying to be as demure and
composed as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches."
2406,"She was regretted by no one at Mansfield.
She had never been able to
attach even those she loved best; and since Mrs. Rushworth’s elopement,
her temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her
everywhere tormenting."
2407,"A considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness,
which was a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly of
larch and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid out with too much
regularity, was darkness and shade, and natural beauty, compared with
the bowling-green and the terrace."
2408,"Then she was shrinking again into
herself, and blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been
enough to give Edmund encouragement for his friend, and as he cordially
thanked him, he hoped to be expressing Fanny’s secret feelings too."
2409,"Fetch the cards; I feel
so very stupid.”
The cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till
bedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds were heard
in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the
game—“And _that_ makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib."
2410,"_Here_, I know, I am of none, and yet I love
the place so well.”
“The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the
house."
2411,"Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.
Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it."
2412,"She was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything; agitated, happy,
miserable, infinitely obliged, absolutely angry."
2413,"""It was greatly my wish that he should do so,"" he added, ""as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on."
2414,"Lady Catherine seemed resigned.
""Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them."
2415,"May God support you
under your share!
We have been here two days, but there is nothing to
be done."
2416,"I declare I do not
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."""
2417,"The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.
Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form."
2418,"Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield."
2419,"A tap at the door roused her in the midst of
this attempt to find her way to her duty, and her gentle “Come in” was
answered by the appearance of one, before whom all her doubts were wont
to be laid."
2420,"I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company."
2421,"“Yes,” he answered, “she is engaged to me; but” (with a smile that did
not sit easy) “she says it is to be the last time that she ever will
dance with me."
2422,"Such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined."
2423,"CHAPTER 16
Catherine’s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street
were so very high that disappointment was inevitable; and accordingly,
though she was most politely received by General Tilney, and kindly
welcomed by his daughter, though Henry was at home, and no one else of
the party, she found, on her return, without spending many hours in the
examination of her feelings, that she had gone to her appointment
preparing for happiness which it had not afforded."
2424,"“Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence.
But, Crawford, though
I refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend."
2425,"His principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham."
2426,"Mr. Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair."
2427,"But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first."
2428,"This Mrs.
     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town."
2429,"""Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"" (for Mrs.
Philips first brought her the news.)"
2430,"Miss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund, now
observed, “Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to
discuss.”
“The most interesting in the world,” replied her brother—“how to make
money; how to turn a good income into a better."
2431,"His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.
His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year."
2432,"I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till
after Easter, a much better time for the visit, but now I cannot put
her off."
2433,"At the end of the first dance, Captain Tilney came towards them again,
and, much to Catherine’s dissatisfaction, pulled his brother away."
2434,"She
was not often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor
did she desire it."
2435,"Every body said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice."
2436,"""Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."""
2437,"“I must really congratulate your ladyship,” said
she, “on the play being chosen; for though you have borne it with
exemplary patience, I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and
difficulties."
2438,"then the point is clear.
Miss Price is not out.”
CHAPTER VI
Mr. Bertram set off for————, and Miss Crawford was prepared to find a
great chasm in their society, and to miss him decidedly in the meetings
which were now becoming almost daily between the families; and on their
all dining together at the Park soon after his going, she retook her
chosen place near the bottom of the table, fully expecting to feel a
most melancholy difference in the change of masters."
2439,"His duties would be
established, but the wife who was to share, and animate, and reward
those duties, might yet be unattainable."
2440,"It is a most interesting work.
You are fond of that kind
of reading?”
“To say the truth, I do not much like any other.”
“Indeed!”
“That is, I can read poetry and plays, and things of that sort, and do
not dislike travels."
2441,"She felt that she must have been of use to all.
To all she must have saved some trouble of head or hand; and were it
only in supporting the spirits of her aunt Bertram, keeping her from
the evil of solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless,
officious companion, too apt to be heightening danger in order to
enhance her own importance, her being there would have been a general
good."
2442,"She has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever."""
2443,"""Well,"" said Charlotte, ""I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth."
2444,"Her sentiments
towards him were compounded of all that was respectful, grateful,
confiding, and tender."
2445,"The next opening of the door brought something more welcome: it was for
the tea-things, which she had begun almost to despair of seeing that
evening."
2446,"“I cannot think well of a man who sports with any
woman’s feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered
than a stander-by can judge of.”
“I do not defend him."
2447,"I had very
little hope of _him_ from the first; but you, Mrs. Grant, my sister, my
own sister, I think I had a right to alarm you a little.”
“Do not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary."
2448,"I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately."
2449,"I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe’s
works, and most of them with great pleasure."
2450,"Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever."
2451,"I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter.
To be
at an early certainty is a material object."
2452,"His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his
situation and rights: he made her some very pretty presents, and
laughed at her."
2453,"To be kept up for hours,
after the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely."
2454,"She was delighted
with each, but Mary was her dearest object; and having never been able
to glory in beauty of her own, she thoroughly enjoyed the power of
being proud of her sister’s."
2455,"Fanny had
hoped, in the course of his yesterday’s visit, to hear the day named;
but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere
long."
2456,"It was ages since she had had a
moment’s conversation with her dearest Catherine; and, though she had
such thousands of things to say to her, it appeared as if they were
never to be together again; so, with smiles of most exquisite misery,
and the laughing eye of utter despondency, she bade her friend adieu
and went on."
2457,"To think of him as Miss Crawford might be
justified in thinking, would in her be insanity."
2458,"""It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,"" he added,
""which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire."
2459,"There were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people
to be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a
need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that
there did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by
youth and zeal could hold out."
2460,"She was
determined to see Fanny alone, and therefore said to her tolerably
soon, in a low voice, “I must speak to you for a few minutes
somewhere”; words that Fanny felt all over her, in all her pulses and
all her nerves."
2461,"Maria, wanting Henry Crawford’s animating
support, thought the subject better avoided."
2462,"From pride,
ignorance, or fashion, our foes are almost as many as our readers."
2463,"I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund—by
ourselves—against the evening, but he is not in the way; and if he
_were_, I do not think I could go through it with _him_, till I have
hardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two."
2464,"Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.
Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections."
2465,"Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing."
2466,"She was come to be happy, and she felt happy
already.
They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street."
2467,"She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it."
2468,"A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme."
2469,"Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him, but sank down again
on finding herself undistinguished in the dusk, and unthought of."
2470,"One morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly four weeks
from Mansfield, a point which she never failed to think over and
calculate every day, as she and Susan were preparing to remove, as
usual, upstairs, they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they
felt they could not avoid, from Rebecca’s alertness in going to the
door, a duty which always interested her beyond any other."
2471,"""Yours, &c.""
As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind."
2472,"“You see what a collection I have,” said she; “more by half than I ever
use or think of."
2473,"With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!
Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,""--recollecting
herself,--""that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."""
2474,"He has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one."
2475,"She had felt an early
presentiment that she _should_ like the eldest best.
She knew it was
her way."
2476,"The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open.
In that corner, however, it is at least out of the way.”
Catherine had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying her
gown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch."
2477,"If, as I am willing to suppose, you wish to
shew me any observance, you will not give way to these emotions, but
endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind."
2478,"""Next time you call,"" said she, ""I hope we shall be more lucky."""
2479,"I cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family."""
2480,"My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be."
2481,"Do you know, she says she does
not want to learn either music or drawing.”
“To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great
want of genius and emulation."
2482,"In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted,
but with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be those
who will be glad of her acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more
liberality and candour on those points than formerly."
2483,"""Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."""
2484,"My
letter was from my brother at Oxford.”
Nothing further was said for a few minutes; and then speaking through
her tears, she added, “I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter
again!”
“I am sorry,” said Henry, closing the book he had just opened; “if I
had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should
have given it with very different feelings.”
“It contained something worse than anybody could suppose!"
2485,"She was struck, however, beyond her expectation, by the grandeur of the
abbey, as she saw it for the first time from the lawn."
2486,"At about
half past twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the
window, and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being
two open carriages at the door, in the first only a servant, her
brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe came
running upstairs, calling out, “Well, Miss Morland, here I am."
2487,"Everything was a friend, or
bore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much
of suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,
her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she
had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost
every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt
Bertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what
was yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and
her friend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had
told her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which
made her tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together,
so harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm."
2488,"""I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man."
2489,"It must be an amusing study.""
""Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing."
2490,"I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"""
2491,"Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page.
She started at its import."
2492,"Would the
veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked, or the volume in which she
had last read, remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper?"
2493,"It is the general
way all young men do.”
“He did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before.”
“He finds the house more agreeable _now_."
2494,"Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were so
closely implicated in Mr. Crawford’s misconduct, that she could not
give his character, such as she believed it, without betraying them."
2495,"single, my dear, to be sure!
A single man of large fortune; four
or five thousand a year."
2496,"After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful."
2497,"Were I
refused, I must bear it; and till I am, I can never cease to try for
her."
2498,"But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related."
2499,"Nobody
wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve
them best, or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they
appear.”
“No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good."
2500,"And as for dancing, do not mention it, I
beg; _that_ is quite out of the question."
2501,"Her father, mother, Sarah, George, and Harriet, all assembled at the
door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awaken
the best feelings of Catherine’s heart; and in the embrace of each, as
she stepped from the carriage, she found herself soothed beyond
anything that she had believed possible."
2502,"William, the eldest, a year older than herself, her
constant companion and friend; her advocate with her mother (of whom he
was the darling) in every distress."
2503,"After wandering about and
sitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings, he had so well
talked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again."
2504,"Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to Sir
Thomas as with any part of it."
2505,"""Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"""
2506,"Believe me, I
have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to
yours."
2507,"""What does Mr. Darcy mean,"" said she to Charlotte, ""by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"""
2508,"My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this.
It is impossible that he should still love
me."""
2509,"Tom Oliver is a very
clever fellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will
see anywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride
over to Stoke, and settle with one of them.”
While he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in
full expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as
this: so contrary to all their first protestations; but Edmund said
nothing."
2510,"That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a
meeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of
conduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_ would
not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity."
2511,"""Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.
But of every other neglect
I can believe him capable."
2512,"Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen."
2513,"Fanny’s spirits lived on it half the
morning, deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being
himself to go away."
2514,"""Eliza Bennet,"" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, ""is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds."
2515,"It had been the shock of conviction as she
read.
The truth rushed on her; and how she could have spoken at all,
how she could even have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder to
herself."
2516,"Could they be perpetrated
without being known, in a country like this, where social and literary
intercourse is on such a footing, where every man is surrounded by a
neighbourhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay
everything open?"
2517,"""But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,"" she added, ""that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason."
2518,"She felt Edmund’s kindness with all, and more than
all, the sensibility which he, unsuspicious of her fond attachment,
could be aware of; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her
account gave her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton
would be nothing without him."
2519,"; but her only offer of exchange
was addressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long
hill, and was not more inviting than this: “Here is a fine burst of
country."
2520,"But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there."
2521,"Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it."
2522,"Her plants, her books—of which she had
been a collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling—her
writing-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within
her reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would
do, she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an
interesting remembrance connected with it."
2523,"""I am not now to learn,"" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, ""that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time."
2524,"She read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her."
2525,"Now we are coming to the
lodge-gates; but we have nearly a mile through the park still."
2526,"Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what
I learnt, to my own family!"
2527,"They lose a great deal.”
“_You_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin.”
“I had a very apt scholar."
2528,"My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies’ ways
as you wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling
which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which
ladies are so generally celebrated."
2529,"Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections."
2530,"She never knew how to be pleasant to
children.
But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she
is behaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you
_must_ be important to her.”
“I can never be important to any one.”
“What is to prevent you?”
“Everything."
2531,"The consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss Crawford’s
attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram’s telling her,
with infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to
undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he had been
most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not
do; he must give it up."
2532,"Mrs.
Allen was not inattentive to it: “Well, my dear,” said she, “suppose
you go.” And in two minutes they were off."
2533,"Poor
little sweet creature!
Well, she was taken away from evil to come."
2534,"They had frequently been staying with her in town.
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions."
2535,"He feared that principle, active
principle, had been wanting; that they had never been properly taught
to govern their inclinations and tempers by that sense of duty which
can alone suffice."
2536,"She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom."
2537,"when I think of this being
the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite
impossible to do anything but love you.”
Fanny was affected."
2538,"very well.” And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herself
again in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning to
fail her already."
2539,"But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--Mr."
2540,"In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,
""I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet."
2541,"Mr. Crawford was in love with Fanny.
He had a pleasing anticipation of
what would be."
2542,"With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she
granted his request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went
with him to the set, may be easily imagined."
2543,"""And then,"" said she, ""if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself."
2544,"""That is the most unforgiving speech,"" said Elizabeth, ""that I ever
heard you utter."
2545,"“But indeed
I would rather have nothing but tea.”
“Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose
you hurry Baddeley a little; he seems behindhand to-night.” She carried
this point, and Sir Thomas’s narrative proceeded."
2546,"Her
uncle’s displeasure was terrible to her; but what could her
justification or her gratitude and attachment do for him?"
2547,"And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same.
But I have a
notion, Miss Morland, you and I think pretty much alike upon most
matters.”
“Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought of."
2548,"Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."""
2549,"And there was my
aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon."
2550,"I trust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent
from home so long again,” were most delightful sentences to her."
2551,"""It is more than I engage for, I assure you.""
""But consider your daughters."
2552,"In my opinion, these
Crawfords are no addition at all.
We did very well without them.”
A small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she did not know how to contradict
him."
2553,"At length however she
was empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowed
necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw just
entering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, with
a firmer determination to be acquainted, than she might have had
courage to command, had she not been urged by the disappointment of the
day before."
2554,"By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy."
2555,"""It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."""
2556,"A great deal more passed at the
other table.
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself."
2557,"You have both warm hearts and benevolent
feelings; and, Fanny, who that heard him read, and saw you listen to
Shakespeare the other night, will think you unfitted as companions?"
2558,"If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that
carpet, I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times; have not I,
Betsey?"
2559,"The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred."
2560,"Mrs. Norris could not see it in the same light.
Lady Bertram did: she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity
of it, and as to its being considered necessary by his father; she only
pleaded against there being any hurry; she only wanted him to wait till
Sir Thomas’s return, and then Sir Thomas might settle it all himself."
2561,"What
is her character?
Is she solemn?
Is she queer?
Is she prudish?"
2562,"He had been
considering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as
a desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he
found himself wholly mistaken."
2563,"Stop me whilst you can.""
""You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."""
2564,"The play had been Lovers’ Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been
Count Cassel."
2565,"He was not near, he was attending a party of ladies out of
the room; and Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm
of each, they followed with the rest."
2566,"Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."""
2567,"""To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding, than I now do of her heart."
2568,"I
find he takes orders in a few weeks.
They were at it in the
dining-parlour."
2569,"“What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest
daughter, a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more
attention than her poor mother could possibly give?"
2570,"Her partner now drew near, and said,
“That gentleman would have put me out of patience, had he stayed with
you half a minute longer."
2571,"He came towards their little circle; but instead of asking
her to dance, drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of the
present state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom, from whom
he had just parted."
2572,"This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards."
2573,"I do not mean to be poor.
Poverty is
exactly what I have determined against."
2574,"It is
one of the finest old places in England, I understand.
I shall depend
upon a most particular description of it.”
“You shall certainly have the best in my power to give."
2575,"To do him
justice, however, he did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering
that there was some very good ranting-ground in Frederick, he professed
an equal willingness for that."
2576,"When they arrived at Mrs. Allen’s door, the astonishment of Isabella
was hardly to be expressed, on finding that it was too late in the day
for them to attend her friend into the house: “Past three o’clock!” It
was inconceivable, incredible, impossible!"
2577,"And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,
""Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr."
2578,"“Let us do nothing
by halves.
If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted
up with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from
beginning to end; so as it be a German play, no matter what, with a
good tricking, shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe,
and a song between the acts."
2579,"Charles Hodges will plague me
to death, I dare say; but I shall cut him very short."
2580,"You know I wanted you, when we first
came, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would."
2581,"What congratulations will
then flow in!
I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."""
2582,"CHAPTER X.
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could."
2583,"""Can you come to-morrow?""
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity."
2584,"Her cause, meanwhile, went on well.
It
began, on Lady Bertram’s part, with—“I have something to tell you that
will surprise you."
2585,"Here was
again a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated
before."
2586,"Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the
same, and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself,
as by far the best day for the purpose."
2587,"""Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"""
2588,"Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it."
2589,"But if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, I must be more explicit."
2590,"But do not tell me—I would not be told
upon any account.
I know it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is
Laurentina’s skeleton."
2591,"Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him."
2592,"Many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible."
2593,"How
great was her disappointment!
the important affair, which many words of
preparation ushered in, had been foreseen by them both ever since her
brother’s arrival; and all that they felt on the occasion was
comprehended in a wish for the young people’s happiness, with a remark,
on the gentleman’s side, in favour of Isabella’s beauty, and on the
lady’s, of her great good luck."
2594,"Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on."
2595,"Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself, and no
inconvenience to Fanny."
2596,"The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been
wanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now
never forgotten."
2597,"And then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it."
2598,"She need not have been uneasy.
There was no sign
of displeasure, or even of hearing her."
2599,"They are at
Brighton now, you know; in one of the best houses there, as Mr.
Rushworth’s fine fortune gives them a right to be."
2600,"I think I shall have Repton.”
“Mr.
Rushworth,” said Lady Bertram, “if I were you, I would have a very
pretty shrubbery."
2601,"This specimen, written in haste as it was, had not a fault; and there
was a felicity in the flow of the first four words, in the arrangement
of “My very dear Fanny,” which she could have looked at for ever."
2602,"She saw that it was.
His letters expressed how much he deplored it."
2603,"She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it."
2604,"Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."""
2605,"He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous."
2606,"It was over at last however.
The
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration."
2607,"But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then."
2608,"My conduct shall speak for
me; absence, distance, time shall speak for me."
2609,"The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement."
2610,"""His misfortunes!""
repeated Darcy contemptuously; ""yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."""
2611,"""Not one.""
""That is very strange.
But I suppose you had no opportunity."
2612,"""I should not be surprised,"" said Darcy, ""if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."""
2613,"We bespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young
performers; we bespeak your indulgence.”
“My indulgence shall be given, sir,” replied Sir Thomas gravely, “but
without any other rehearsal.” And with a relenting smile, he added, “I
come home to be happy and indulgent.” Then turning away towards any or
all of the rest, he tranquilly said, “Mr."
2614,"""Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.
You know my sentiments."""
2615,"A low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing."
2616,"In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her."
2617,"Here was a change, and here were claims which could not but operate!"
2618,"Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart."
2619,"Had their party been perfectly
agreeable, the delay would have been nothing; but General Tilney,
though so charming a man, seemed always a check upon his children’s
spirits, and scarcely anything was said but by himself; the observation
of which, with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded, and his
angry impatience at the waiters, made Catherine grow every moment more
in awe of him, and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four."
2620,"pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.
I
hope he will overlook it."
2621,"He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the
Antwerp,” was a tender apostrophe of Fanny’s, very much to the purpose
of her own feelings if not of the conversation."
2622,"But
it is not to be a display of that sort.
We mean nothing but a little
amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our
powers in something new."
2623,"An advantage this, a strengthener of love, in
which even the conjugal tie is beneath the fraternal."
2624,"But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."""
2625,"Would it make you happy to write to William?”
“Yes, very.”
“Then let it be done now."
2626,"It was a very proper wedding.
The bride was elegantly dressed; the two
bridesmaids were duly inferior; her father gave her away; her mother
stood with salts in her hand, expecting to be agitated; her aunt tried
to cry; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant."
2627,"Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family."
2628,"let me look at her this moment.
What a
delightful girl!
i never saw anything half so beautiful!"
2629,"We only speak of it among
friends.
But I have very little doubt it _will_ be."
2630,"I
am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris.”
“Indeed!”
“Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so."
2631,"His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature."
2632,"It was three months, full three months, since her quitting it,
and the change was from winter to summer."
2633,"""What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.
Darcy!--There
is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."""
2634,"""What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?""
--said Jane as she
finished it."
2635,"I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she
has ever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else."
2636,"Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return."
2637,"I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied she
might wish for a partner; but he is quite mistaken, for she would not
dance upon any account in the world.”
Henry smiled, and said, “How very little trouble it can give you to
understand the motive of other people’s actions.”
“Why?"
2638,"She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended."
2639,"""You are then resolved to have him?""
""I have said no such thing."
2640,"It was as much as I
could bear myself.
Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him
from the flower-beds, was almost too much for me.”
Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table,
on which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira to
Fanny, and obliged her to drink the greater part."
2641,"I do
not censure her _opinions_; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in
making them public.”
“Do not you think,” said Fanny, after a little consideration, “that
this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her
niece has been entirely brought up by her?"
2642,"There were three different conclusions to be
drawn from his silence, between which her mind was in fluctuation; each
of them at times being held the most probable."
2643,"There was little
intercourse with the Parsonage.
Sir Thomas, drawing back from
intimacies in general, was particularly disinclined, at this time, for
any engagements but in one quarter."
2644,"She began to be surprised at being left so long, and to
listen with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices
again."
2645,"The early habit of reading was wanting.
Their conversations, however, were not always on subjects so high as
history or morals."
2646,"I apprehend he will not have less than seven
hundred a year.
Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger
brother; and as of course he will still live at home, it will be all
for his _menus_ _plaisirs_; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter, I
suppose, will be the sum total of sacrifice.”
His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying, “Nothing amuses
me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance
of those who have a great deal less than themselves."
2647,"""I am astonished,"" said Miss Bingley, ""that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr."
2648,"Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you."
2649,"“Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer.”
“My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St.
Paul’s, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you
could be."
2650,"I had not, Miss
Crawford, been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him
and some part of this family in the summer and autumn."
2651,"""I do not know when I have been more shocked,"" said she."
2652,"Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed."
2653,"While
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes."
2654,"He pressed
her hand, looked at her, and was gone.
_He_ went to while away the next
three hours as he could, with his other acquaintance, till the best
dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment, and
_she_ turned in to her more simple one immediately."
2655,"Amazingly
conceited, I am sure.
I took him down several times, you know, in my
way.”
When the young ladies next met, they had a far more interesting subject
to discuss."
2656,"It is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself.
He was
suffering from disappointment and regret, grieving over what was, and
wishing for what could never be."
2657,"Have you seen any pleasant men?
Have you had any
flirting?
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back."
2658,"Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room."
2659,"I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,” he
repeated, his voice sinking a little, “between the two dearest objects
I have on earth.”
He was gone as he spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as
she could."
2660,"The meeting was very satisfactory on each side.
Miss Crawford found a
sister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister’s husband who looked
the gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs.
Grant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young
man and woman of very prepossessing appearance."
2661,"She could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford’s attachment
would hold out for ever; she could not but imagine that steady,
unceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time."
2662,"It was a good spot for
fault-finding.
Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr.
Rushworth; and when, after a little time, the others began to form into
parties, these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by
Edmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and
who, after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties,
left them and walked on."
2663,"Our poor mother
     is sadly grieved.
My father bears it better.
How thankful am I,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves."
2664,"For my own pleasure, I could stay with you as
long again.” And it was directly settled that, till she had, her
leaving them was not even to be thought of."
2665,"Mrs. Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her."
2666,"""Or in other words, you are determined to have him.
He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane."
2667,"They battled it
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
     or lady concerned in it deserved."
2668,"“Very true: we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe, and then we wanted for
nothing."
2669,"The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt the
total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr.
Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for
the evening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal
being renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were
over, and he might be at leisure to be amused by it."
2670,"Does he want a horse?
Here is a friend of
mine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that would suit anybody."
2671,"I do not believe she often sees such at home.""
""The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."""
2672,"They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia."
2673,"They were ignorant, idle, and vain.
While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
ever."
2674,"She feared for William; by no means convinced by
all that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries,
of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged, the rough
horses and mules he had ridden, or his many narrow escapes from
dreadful falls, that he was at all equal to the management of a
high-fed hunter in an English fox-chase; nor till he returned safe and
well, without accident or discredit, could she be reconciled to the
risk, or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the
horse which he had fully intended it should produce."
2675,"I would
not, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing.”
“Catherine, you must go,” said James."
2676,"“It is amazing,” said she, “how much young people cost their friends,
what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world!"
2677,"I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me.""
""The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."""
2678,"The erection of the monument itself could
not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney’s actual
decease."
2679,"Catherine’s spirits
revived as they drove from the door; for with Miss Tilney she felt no
restraint; and, with the interest of a road entirely new to her, of an
abbey before, and a curricle behind, she caught the last view of Bath
without any regret, and met with every milestone before she expected
it."
2680,"The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages."
2681,"Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.
His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure."
2682,"Stranger things have happened.
I dare say they are trying for it.
And they are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty
establishment for them."
2683,"Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them."
2684,"Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,
""Miss Elizabeth Bennet.""
""Miss Elizabeth Bennet!"""
2685,"Your cousin Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by
parish duties.
There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be
converted."
2686,"If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him."
2687,"No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants."
2688,"Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,
""It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably."
2689,"They will now see
what sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of
sense."
2690,"""Yes, always,"" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, ""I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable."
2691,"He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book."
2692,"So many
months’ acquaintance!
But compliments may be sufficient here.
Was his
letter a long one?"
2693,"“When Fanny is known to him,” continued Henry, “he will doat on her."
2694,"I wonder anybody can ever go
to sea.”
To Henry Crawford they gave a different feeling."
2695,"By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration."
2696,"All that English
abilities can do has been tried already.
I have three very particular
friends who have been all dying for him in their turn; and the pains
which they, their mothers (very clever women), as well as my dear aunt
and myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick him into marrying, is
inconceivable!"
2697,"On his
side the inclination was stronger, on hers less equivocal.
His
objections, the scruples of his integrity, seemed all done away, nobody
could tell how; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were
equally got over—and equally without apparent reason."
2698,"What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield
was to become a slight evil at Portsmouth."
2699,"""I leave it to yourself to determine,"" said Mr. Bennet.
END OF VOL."
2700,"Another day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise.
In _his_ departure
Sir Thomas felt the chief interest: wanting to be alone with his
family, the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been
irksome; but of him, trifling and confident, idle and expensive, it was
every way vexatious."
2701,"She declared her resolution.
""How can you be so silly,"" cried her mother, ""as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt!"
2702,"The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse."
2703,"With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry."
2704,"You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf."
2705,"You would look
rather blank, Henry, if your _menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to
seven hundred a year.”
“Perhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is entirely comparative."
2706,"The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation."
2707,"Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
""And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"""
2708,"I will try again.
At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not."
2709,"Such insolence of behaviour as Miss
Tilney’s she had never heard of in her life!"
2710,"The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every mind
was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his
daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony."
2711,"There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself."
2712,"“I only wish I could do as
much.
One could not expect more from him, you know."
2713,"The first wish
of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and
almost her first resolution, to seek her for that purpose, in the
pump-room at noon."
2714,"But do not stay here to be cold.”
He went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure for Fanny."
2715,"Do not you think we have?”
“Not half a mile,” was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much in
love as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness."
2716,"I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_."
2717,"Let her chuse for
herself, as well as the rest of us.
Her judgment may be quite as safely
trusted."
2718,"Under a mistaken persuasion of her
possessions and claims, he had courted her acquaintance in Bath,
solicited her company at Northanger, and designed her for his
daughter-in-law."
2719,"Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency."
2720,"Eleanor seemed now
impelled into resolution and speech.
“You _must_ write to me, Catherine,” she cried; “you _must_ let me hear
from you as soon as possible."
2721,"He saw how ill he had judged, in expecting to counteract what
was wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself; clearly saw that he
had but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in
his presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him, and
sending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able to
attach them only by the blindness of her affection, and the excess of
her praise."
2722,"She was not to be prevailed
on to leave Mr. Crawford.
She hoped to marry him, and they continued
together till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain,
and till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the
conviction rendered her temper so bad, and her feelings for him so like
hatred, as to make them for a while each other’s punishment, and then
induce a voluntary separation."
2723,"And you may say, if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive
airs against his return, in compassion to his feelings, as I know his
horse will lose.”
“If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not, at present,
foresee any occasion for writing.”
“No, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you
ever write to him, nor he to you, if it could be helped."
2724,"These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually brought
their alleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his sense of what was lost,
and in part reconciling him to himself; though the anguish arising from
the conviction of his own errors in the education of his daughters was
never to be entirely done away."
2725,"For a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford had
endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and
compliment, but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a
few repulses; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for
more than one flirtation, he grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather
thought it a lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might
ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant."
2726,"And, upon my word, there are
some things that seem very like it."
2727,"He could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump."
2728,"You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of
your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that real
jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no
disagreement between them can be of any duration."
2729,"Everybody was shortly in motion for
tea, and they must squeeze out like the rest."
2730,"I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."""
2731,"I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced.""
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London."
2732,"do not repeat what I then said.
These recollections will not do at
all."
2733,"This is my
advice.
I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose
intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure, and in whose
characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and
natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences, resulting
principally from situation, no reasonable hindrance to a perfect
friendship."
2734,"_I_ say it is no bad notion.”
“I am sure I think it a very good one.”
“Do you?"
2735,"A monstrous deal of good nature, and it is not only
good nature, but you have so much, so much of everything; and then you
have such—upon my soul, I do not know anybody like you.”
“Oh!"
2736,"It was plain that he could have no serious views, no true
attachment, by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she
would never stoop to."
2737,"so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible!"
2738,"She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."""
2739,"I know so many who have married in the full expectation and
confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion, or
accomplishment, or good quality in the person, who have found
themselves entirely deceived, and been obliged to put up with exactly
the reverse."
2740,"I dare say it will not be a very good ball.
I
know the Mitchells will not be there."
2741,"Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view."
2742,"The earliest intelligence of the travellers’ safe arrival at Antigua,
after a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris
had been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund
participate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended
on being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,
she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,
when Sir Thomas’s assurances of their both being alive and well made it
necessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches
for a while."
2743,"Now she is dependent, helpless,
friendless, neglected, forgotten.”
“Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or
forgotten."
2744,"""No more have I,"" said Mr. Bennet; ""and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."""
2745,"Yes, these were
characteristic sounds; they brought to her recollection a countless
variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes, which such buildings
had witnessed, and such storms ushered in; and most heartily did she
rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within
walls so solemn!"
2746,"She was sick of exploring, and
desired but to be safe in her own room, with her own heart only privy
to its folly; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she
had entered, when the sound of footsteps, she could hardly tell where,
made her pause and tremble."
2747,"The former she hoped at last might have been
accidental, and the latter she could only attribute to her own
stupidity."
2748,"""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"" said her mother
resentfully, ""since we are not to visit."""
2749,"I am almost
ashamed to make the request, though its presumption would certainly
appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself."
2750,"Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself."
2751,"He saw her lips formed into a _no_,
though the sound was inarticulate, but her face was like scarlet."
2752,"""My dear, dear
aunt,"" she rapturously cried, ""what delight!"
2753,"Well, the thing is this: I have just
had a letter from John; you can guess the contents.”
“No, indeed, I cannot.”
“My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected."
2754,"Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage."
2755,"""But, my dear Elizabeth,"" she added, ""what sort of girl is Miss King?"
2756,"“It was
really like being at a play,” said she.
“I wish Sir Thomas had been
here.”
Crawford was excessively pleased."
2757,"In
that house, which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr.
Norris’s death, she became a welcome, an invited guest, and in the
gloom and dirt of a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford."
2758,"Do not let us be
frightened from a good deed by a trifle.
Give a girl an education, and
introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the
means of settling well, without farther expense to anybody."
2759,"In her present
exile from good society, and distance from everything that had been
wont to interest her, a letter from one belonging to the set where her
heart lived, written with affection, and some degree of elegance, was
thoroughly acceptable."
2760,"oh, heavens!
i make it a rule never to mind what they say."
2761,"“If I had known you were going out, I should have got you just to go as
far as my house with some orders for Nanny,” said she, “which I have
since, to my very great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carry
myself."
2762,"The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever."
2763,"I need not ask you whether you are happy here,
my dear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe,
it would be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am
sure, are very kind to you?”
“Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it
will be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far
on purpose to see _me_.”
James accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his conscience
for accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity, “Indeed,
Catherine, I love you dearly.”
Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, the
situation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters now
passed between them, and continued, with only one small digression on
James’s part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached Pulteney
Street, where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs.
Allen, invited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the
latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and
tippet."
2764,"She was soon more softened and sorrowful.
His warm regard, his kind expressions, his confidential treatment,
touched her strongly."
2765,"At a distance,
unassailed by his looks or his kindness, and safe from the perpetual
irritation of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his confidence,
she should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she should
be able to think of him as in London, and arranging everything there,
without wretchedness."
2766,"On this _rencontre_ they all returned to the house together, there to
lounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, and
Quarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of
dinner."
2767,"oh, d—— it!
i would not sell my horse for a hundred."
2768,"I walk about
here, and so I do there; but here I see a variety of people in every
street, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen.”
Mr. Tilney was very much amused."
2769,"But I can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."""
2770,"“This has been a strange acquaintance,” observed Mrs. Morland, as the
letter was finished; “soon made and soon ended."
2771,"“Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble.
The difference of fortune can be
nothing to signify.”
“Oh!"
2772,"""Why will you think so?
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master."
2773,"She is the very impossibility he would describe, if
indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas."
2774,"And as to the
not missing her, which under Mrs. Norris’s discussion was the point
attempted to be proved, she set herself very steadily against admitting
any such thing."
2775,"That
the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her
brother and my sister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended
not to say), but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself,
giving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill
consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance
of decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all,
recommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the
continuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as
I now thought of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought;
all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never
understood her before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been
the creature of my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been
too apt to dwell on for many months past."
2776,"i wonder whether it
will be a full ball or not!
they have not begun dancing yet."
2777,"there are few people much about town that I do not know.
I
have met him forever at the Bedford; and I knew his face again to-day
the moment he came into the billiard-room."
2778,"They are given wrong notions from the
beginning.
They are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is
no more real modesty in their behaviour _before_ they appear in public
than afterwards.”
“I do not know,” replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly."
2779,"These reflections were long
indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion, who sat as deep
in thought as herself; and the appearance of the carriage was the first
thing to startle and recall them to the present moment."
2780,"How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject,
I will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly
disappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London!"
2781,"“Yes, I dare say you will; _that’s_ natural enough."
2782,"I must look
down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to
distinction.”
“But how may it rise?"
2783,"Everybody around her was gay and busy, prosperous
and important; each had their object of interest, their part, their
dress, their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all were
finding employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in
the playful conceits they suggested."
2784,"How shall I bear
it?
And my poor aunt talking of me every hour!”
Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could, but
she was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was
quite unkind, both to her aunt and to herself."
2785,"I should
be so glad to have you dance.
There goes a strange-looking woman!"
2786,"“Fanny
has been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you
coming.” And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the
air of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare."
2787,"I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for
me—but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side; I never had
the smallest idea of it."
2788,"Here
everybody was noisy, every voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her
mother’s, which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram’s, only
worn into fretfulness)."
2789,"She is grown so brown and coarse!
Louisa and I were agreeing that we
should not have known her again."""
2790,"a clever fancy of Morland’s and Belle’s.
What do you think of it, Miss Morland?"
2791,"March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford.
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty."
2792,"When really touched by affliction, her active powers had been
all benumbed; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her
the smallest support or attempt at support."
2793,"This second
instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck
Catherine as very remarkable."
2794,"After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed,
""From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country."
2795,"They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day."
2796,"As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery."
2797,"She stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery."
2798,"No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of
his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately.”
“No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,” said Edmund,
“from one’s earliest years."
2799,"He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could."
2800,"Scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a
place, however, when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe, who
stood behind her."
2801,"Was it the
part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others?"
2802,"not seriously!”
“Aye, and sadly too—for I had much rather stay.”
“But how can you think of such a thing, after what the General said?"
2803,"""'Tis an etiquette I despise,"" said he.
""If he wants our society, let
him seek it."
2804,"Mrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her children
everything they ought to be; but her time was so much occupied in
lying-in and teaching the little ones, that her elder daughters were
inevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful
that Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should
prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the
country at the age of fourteen, to books—or at least books of
information—for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be
gained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she
had never any objection to books at all."
2805,"And
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information."
2806,"Poor Mr. Norris’s indifferent state of
health made it an impossibility: he could no more bear the noise of a
child than he could fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of his
gouty complaints, it would be a different matter: she should then be
glad to take her turn, and think nothing of the inconvenience; but just
now, poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her time, and the very
mention of such a thing she was sure would distract him."
2807,"And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one
who has been shot at by so many; of having it in one’s power to pay off
the debts of one’s sex!"
2808,"and it is a great
comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature, but can shift
very well for herself.”
Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable
resentment of a sensible friend; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions
quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself."
2809,"“My dear Henry, have _you_ nothing to say?
You have been an improver
yourself, and from what I hear of Everingham, it may vie with any place
in England."
2810,"Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive."
2811,"""Nothing child, nothing.
I did not wink at you.""
She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,
""Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,"" took her out of the room."
2812,"modesty, and
all that, is very well in its way, but really a little common honesty
is sometimes quite as becoming."
2813,"“My dear, you give yourself a great deal of needless
trouble,” said her mother at last; “depend upon it, it is something not
at all worth understanding.”
“I can allow for his wishing Catherine away, when he recollected this
engagement,” said Sarah, “but why not do it civilly?”
“I am sorry for the young people,” returned Mrs. Morland; “they must
have a sad time of it; but as for anything else, it is no matter now;
Catherine is safe at home, and our comfort does not depend upon General
Tilney.” Catherine sighed."
2814,"Lady Bertram’s being just on the other side of the table was
a trifle, for she might always be considered as only half-awake, and
Edmund’s advertisements were still of the first utility."
2815,"The gentleman was not so easily satisfied.
He had all the
disposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him."
2816,"I am sure it is not in woman’s nature to
refuse such a triumph.”
Fanny shook her head."
2817,"Upon this conviction, she would not be surprised if even in
Henry and Eleanor Tilney, some slight imperfection might hereafter
appear; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some
actual specks in the character of their father, who, though cleared
from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have
entertained, she did believe, upon serious consideration, to be not
perfectly amiable."
2818,"But I left no stone unturned.
I was
ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister, and at last I did
persuade her."
2819,"It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."""
2820,"Instantaneously, with the
consciousness of existence, returned her recollection of the
manuscript; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid’s
going away, she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst
from the roll on its falling to the ground, and flew back to enjoy the
luxury of their perusal on her pillow."
2821,"Fanny felt that there must be a
struggle in Edmund’s cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the
effort so successfully made."
2822,"that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him."
2823,"“Come,
come, it would be very un-handsome in us to be severe on Mrs.
Rushworth, for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay,
brilliant, happy hours."
2824,"She is a most amiable girl;
such a superior understanding!
how fond all the family are of her; she
is evidently the general favourite; and how much she must be admired in
such a place as this—is not she?”
“Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest
girl in Bath.”
“I dare say he does; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of
beauty than Mr. Allen."
2825,"my dear brother,"" replied Mrs. Bennet, ""that is exactly what I
could most wish for."
2826,"But, alas!
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question."
2827,"He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
""He is as fine a fellow,"" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, ""as ever I saw."
2828,"Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy?
Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"""
2829,"When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful."
2830,"But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.”
The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected."
2831,"My kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till I am better."
2832,"He believed it fully.
Love such as his, in a man like himself,
must with perseverance secure a return, and at no great distance; and
he had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a
very short time, that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted."
2833,"we hear nothing of Mr. Yates.
I do not imagine he
figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park; do you, Miss Price?"
2834,"""And I certainly _never_ shall give it.
I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable."
2835,"“I cannot admit
Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall
both have a right in you."
2836,"She was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had
represented."
2837,"I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.
It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."""
2838,"“I wonder at that.
But
I dare say you know exactly—I always imagine you are—perhaps you do not
think him likely to marry at all—or not at present.”
“No, I do not,” said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err either in the
belief or the acknowledgment of it."
2839,"How could I
     be so silly as to wish it!
Your idea of the ponies is delightful."
2840,"Why did
such an idea occur to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden?"
2841,"What a happy creature William must be!
I wish we could see him.”
Poor Fanny’s mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its
varieties."
2842,"""But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"""
2843,"Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of ""Lord,
how tired I am!"""
2844,"“My dearest creature,” cried Isabella, to whom the duty of
friendship immediately called her before she could get into the
carriage, “you have been at least three hours getting ready."
2845,"Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them."
2846,"How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!"
2847,"If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him."
2848,"Could it be possible, or did not her senses play her false?
An
inventory of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that
was before her!"
2849,"I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude."
2850,"This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.""
""Not as you represent it."
2851,"But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again."
2852,"The loveliness of the day, and of the view, he felt like herself."
2853,"“You must have been aware,” continued Sir Thomas presently, “you must
have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford’s manners
to you."
2854,"You must have seen that he was trying to
please you by every attention in his power."
2855,"I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit."
2856,"She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance.
A misplaced
shame.
Where people wish to attach, they should always be ignorant."
2857,"“It remains as it
was, I suppose?” said she, in a tone of feeling."
2858,"d—,’ said I; ‘I am your man; what do you ask?’ And how
much do you think he did, Miss Morland?”
“I am sure I cannot guess at all.”
“Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board,
lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good as
new, or better."
2859,"would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.
""How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?"""
2860,"“I shall always look back on our
theatricals with exquisite pleasure.
There was such an interest, such
an animation, such a spirit diffused."
2861,"The subject had
been already handled in the drawing-room; it was revived in the
dining-parlour."
2862,"They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,
""But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."""
2863,"I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you,
no doubt, are perfectly able to give it."
2864,"Here was comfort indeed!
and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place
dependence on such sources of good, Edmund was contributing to his
father’s ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given
him pain before—improvement in his spirits."
2865,"“So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistaken
who wished you to do otherwise."
2866,"But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice."
2867,"When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room."
2868,"Fanny
found herself obliged to yield, that she might not be accused of pride
or indifference, or some other littleness; and having with modest
reluctance given her consent, proceeded to make the selection."
2869,"The manner in
which it was done so grossly uncivil, hurrying her away without any
reference to her own convenience, or allowing her even the appearance
of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling; of two days, the
earliest fixed on, and of that almost the earliest hour, as if resolved
to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning, that he might
not be obliged even to see her."
2870,"Their departure made another material change at Mansfield, a chasm
which required some time to fill up."
2871,"“What do they bring
but disappointment and sorrow?
Not till after Easter!"
2872,"And this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace."
2873,"Her love of
dirt gave way to an inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she
grew smart; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father
and mother remark on her personal improvement."
2874,"Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure."
2875,"Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation."
2876,"_She_ had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or
drunken gallants.
Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had
told her that morning."
2877,"We will ask him.
But he will be very much surprised
that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.”
There was nothing more to be said, or that could be said to any
purpose, till Sir Thomas were present; but the subject involving, as it
did, her own evening’s comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in
Lady Bertram’s mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his looking in
for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing-room, she
called him back again, when he had almost closed the door, with “Sir
Thomas, stop a moment—I have something to say to you.”
Her tone of calm languor, for she never took the trouble of raising her
voice, was always heard and attended to; and Sir Thomas came back."
2878,"She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked
to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion."
2879,"John Thorpe, in the meanwhile, had walked
away; and Catherine, ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of
repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once,
made her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could, in the
hope of finding him still with them—a hope which, when it proved to be
fruitless, she felt to have been highly unreasonable."
2880,"They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."""
2881,"If, indeed, it should be so!
But I dare not
hope it."
2882,"Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and
took her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for
comfortable use; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart,
and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before her than ever
that spot had yet witnessed."
2883,"As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of
Edmund, Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny’s use; and had
Lady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might have
been excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas’s return in
September, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and
without any near prospect of finishing his business."
2884,"“You have been here a month, I think?” said he."
2885,"By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him
courteous."
2886,"Her next proposition, of shewing the house to such of them
as had not been there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertram was
pleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doing
something."
2887,"Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat."
2888,"They must now
rehearse together.
Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,
not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was
wanted only to prompt and observe them."
2889,"The sisters,
handsome, clever, and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind;
and finding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of
Mansfield, he gladly returned to it at the time appointed, and was
welcomed thither quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with
further."
2890,"We acted with the best intentions.""
""Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
wife?"""
2891,"It was upon the behaviour of these very
slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended; and while
Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the
justness of her own representations, Catherine was silently reflecting
that _now_ Henry must have arrived at Northanger; _now_ he must have
heard of her departure; and _now_, perhaps, they were all setting off
for Hereford."
2892,"Her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room."
2893,"she must think me an idiot, or she
could not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make her
character better known to me than mine is to her."
2894,"It
was more pleasant than prudent.
We were getting too noisy.” And then
turning the conversation, he would have engaged her on some other
subject, but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not
advance in any."
2895,"Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter, without communicating
its contents to any creature at Mansfield, when it was followed by
another, sent express from the same friend, to break to him the almost
desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people."
2896,"""I thank you for my share of the favour,"" said Elizabeth; ""but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."""
2897,"In
understanding Darcy was the superior.
Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever."
2898,"She
was less and less able to endure the restraint which her father
imposed."
2899,"Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine, and
fancy you did not come honestly by it?"
2900,"“Shall you be at the cotillion ball to-morrow?”
“Perhaps we—Yes, I think we certainly shall.”
“I am glad of it, for we shall all be there.” This civility was duly
returned; and they parted—on Miss Tilney’s side with some knowledge of
her new acquaintance’s feelings, and on Catherine’s, without the
smallest consciousness of having explained them."
2901,"Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very
near them, and not at all displeased either at her sister’s early care,
or the choice it had fallen on."
2902,"They proceeded
upstairs together, their rooms being on the same floor above.
“I come from Dr. Grant’s,” said Edmund presently."
2903,"You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."""
2904,"i assure you, I can hardly exist till I see him.”
“No,” said Catherine, “he is not here; I cannot see him anywhere.”
“Oh, horrid!"
2905,"""I knew,"" said he, ""that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary."
2906,"I am so
glad it is over!
my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his
nonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye
was upon us.”
“He is very handsome indeed.”
“Handsome!"
2907,"A lively imagination soon settled it all.
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her."
2908,"Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to
Lady Bertram in lieu of her son, and Dr. Grant was to join them at
dinner."
2909,"he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."""
2910,"""They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."""
2911,"What an
unworthy attachment!
To be deriving support from the commendations of
Mrs. Fraser!"
2912,"“Suppose we turn down here for the present,” said Mrs. Rushworth,
civilly taking the hint and following them."
2913,"“When I wear this necklace I
shall always think of you,” said she, “and feel how very kind you
were.”
“You must think of somebody else too, when you wear that necklace,”
replied Miss Crawford."
2914,"From Saturday to Wednesday, however, they were now to be without Henry."
2915,"Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.
Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it."
2916,"Your gown seems
very pretty.
I like these glossy spots.
Has not Miss Crawford a gown
something the same?”
In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard and
coach-house."
2917,"She regarded her cousin as an example
of everything good and great, as possessing worth which no one but
herself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude from
her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay."
2918,"My father means to fetch you himself, but it will not be till after
Easter, when he has business in town."
2919,"Finish it at once.
Let there be an end
of this suspense.
Fix, commit, condemn yourself.”
Such sensations, however, were too near akin to resentment to be long
guiding Fanny’s soliloquies."
2920,"If a speech be well drawn
up, I read it with pleasure, by whomsoever it may be made—and probably
with much greater, if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson, than
if the genuine words of Caractacus, Agricola, or Alfred the Great.”
“You are fond of history!"
2921,"They had
their faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out.
The Doctor was very
fond of eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant,
instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook
as high wages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seen
in her offices."
2922,"""Mr. Darcy is all politeness,"" said Elizabeth, smiling.
""He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"""
2923,"Upon recollection,
however, I have a notion they are both dead; at least the mother is;
yes, I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead, because Mrs. Hughes told me there
was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter
on her wedding-day and that Miss Tilney has got now, for they were put
by for her when her mother died.”
“And is Mr. Tilney, my partner, the only son?”
“I cannot be quite positive about that, my dear; I have some idea he
is; but, however, he is a very fine young man, Mrs. Hughes says, and
likely to do very well.”
Catherine inquired no further; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs.
Allen had no real intelligence to give, and that she was most
particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with
both brother and sister."
2924,"It is remarkable, however, that she neither insisted on
Catherine’s writing by every post, nor exacted her promise of
transmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detail of
every interesting conversation that Bath might produce."
2925,"Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable."
2926,"But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character."
2927,"“I do not want her at all for myself,” said he; “but whenever you are
next inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to
have her a longer time—for a whole morning, in short."
2928,"She should
have to do the honours of the evening; and this reflection quickly
restored so much of her good-humour as enabled her to join in with the
others, before their happiness and thanks were all expressed."
2929,"And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment."
2930,"""I am sure there is not on _his_.
I will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her."
2931,"Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.
He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there."
2932,"There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well."
2933,"Edmund
might, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he might
read prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he might
ride over every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through
divine service; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every
seventh day, for three or four hours, if that would content him."
2934,"It would
probably be the middle of November at least; the middle of November was
three months off."
2935,"This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity
of a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself, of her past
adventures and sufferings, which might otherwise be expected to occupy
the three or four following chapters; in which the worthlessness of
lords and attorneys might be set forth, and conversations, which had
passed twenty years before, be minutely repeated."
2936,"CHAPTER 17
The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath; and
whether it should be the last was for some time a question, to which
Catherine listened with a beating heart."
2937,"Mrs. Fraser (no bad
judge) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a
person, height, and air; and I must confess, when he dined here the
other day, there were none to compare with him, and we were a party of
sixteen."
2938,"Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success."
2939,"Nor can I think it wrong that it
should.
There was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see
no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he
will have a competence early in life."
2940,"""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,""
said he."
2941,"Persuade him to let things take their course.
If by any
officious exertions of his, she is induced to leave Henry’s protection,
there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain
with him."
2942,"""I certainly shall not.
You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner."
2943,"She
will have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very
well; and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will
answer for his being most happy to join the party."
2944,"Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report."
2945,"Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved."
2946,"In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin."
2947,"John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine, and, after a few minutes’
silence, renewed the conversation about his gig."
2948,"""Exceed their income!
My dear Mr. Bennet,"" cried his wife, ""what are you
talking of?"
2949,"""There is a gentleman with him, mamma,"" said Kitty; ""who can it be?"""
2950,"But the inexplicability of the General’s conduct dwelt much
on her thoughts."
2951,"""Yes; he introduced us to his sister.""
""And do you like her?"""
2952,"This is the truth.
The only question is _how_?
What may be the
likeliest means?"
2953,"The rest of the way is such as it ought to be.
Mr. Rushworth
has made it since he succeeded to the estate."
2954,"You are to have the book, of course.
Now for
it.
We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the
front of the stage."
2955,"She had changed
her position; and, with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows,
was listening to her uncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay."
2956,"My father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education."
2957,"""And pray
may I ask?""
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, ""Is it in
address that he improves?"
2958,"Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought his father a
little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could
produce any."
2959,"Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the
play as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure
to _her_ to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the
first act, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for
Maria."
2960,"That punishment, the public punishment of disgrace, should in a just
measure attend _his_ share of the offence is, we know, not one of the
barriers which society gives to virtue."
2961,"He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband."
2962,"I wish
Margaret were married, for my poor friend’s sake, for I look upon the
Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people."
2963,"it
is a very nice word indeed!
it does for everything.
Originally perhaps
it was applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or
refinement—people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, or
their choice."
2964,"Though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed."
2965,"Its origin—jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty—was yet to be
unravelled.
In revolving these matters, while she undressed, it suddenly struck her
as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very
spot of this unfortunate woman’s confinement—might have been within a
few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days; for what
part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which
yet bore the traces of monastic division?"
2966,"It is admirable!""
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile."
2967,"Her mind, disposition, opinions, and habits
wanted no half-concealment, no self-deception on the present, no
reliance on future improvement."
2968,"I think you cannot stand out
any longer now.
The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a
friend—I shall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse.”
This was the first time of her brother’s openly siding against her, and
anxious to avoid his displeasure, she proposed a compromise."
2969,"If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss
Tilney myself."
2970,"You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!
I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say."
2971,"She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse."
2972,"These
shared her heart: her time was given chiefly to her house and her
servants."
2973,"how are your absent cousins to understand the tenor of your
life in Bath without one?"
2974,"They walked off, utterly
heedless of Mr. Rushworth’s repeated question of, “Shall I go too?"
2975,"“You may guess my
errand there, Fanny.” And he looked so conscious, that Fanny could
think but of one errand, which turned her too sick for speech."
2976,"In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise."
2977,"“Write to James on her
behalf!
no, James should never hear Isabella’s name mentioned by her
again.”
On Henry’s arrival from Woodston, she made known to him and Eleanor
their brother’s safety, congratulating them with sincerity on it, and
reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong
indignation."
2978,"""What is there of good to be expected?""
said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; ""but perhaps you would like to read it."""
2979,"That time, however, did
gradually come, forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her
own, and much less encumbered by refinement or self-distrust."
2980,"It was the gift of her good godmother, old Mrs.
Admiral Maxwell, only six weeks before she was taken for death."
2981,"She has a wonderful play
of feature!
But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you,
Fanny, as not quite right?”
“Oh yes!"
2982,"He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein."
2983,"""You have.
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember."""
2984,"It is now half after one; we drove out of
the inn-yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven; and I defy any
man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in
harness; that makes it exactly twenty-five.”
“You have lost an hour,” said Morland; “it was only ten o’clock when we
came from Tetbury.”
“Ten o’clock!"
2985,"“My brother does know it,” was Henry’s answer.
“Does he?"
2986,"Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not
have happened.
Susan too was a grievance."
2987,"It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.
In a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost."
2988,"I owe all that I know
of it, to another, not to you."""
2989,"That is very disagreeable.
I wish we had a large
acquaintance here.”
“I wish we had _any;_—it would be somebody to go to.”
“Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them
directly."
2990,"That any bookseller should think it
worth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while to publish
seems extraordinary."
2991,"Agatha and
Amelia appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for
home representation—the situation of one, and the language of the
other, so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she could
hardly suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging
in; and longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the
remonstrance which Edmund would certainly make."
2992,"The
rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron."
2993,"Am I right?
Do you agree with me, my dear?”
“Yes, sir.”
It was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was easy on the
score of the cousins."
2994,"Her plan for the morning thus settled,
she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast, resolving to remain
in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one;
and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and
ejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for
thinking were such, that as she never talked a great deal, so she could
never be entirely silent; and, therefore, while she sat at her work, if
she lost her needle or broke her thread, if she heard a carriage in the
street, or saw a speck upon her gown, she must observe it aloud,
whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not."
2995,"Perhaps it may seem odd,
that with only two younger children, I should think any profession
necessary for him; and certainly there are moments when we could all
wish him disengaged from every tie of business."
2996,"as to _that_, Papa and Mamma were in
no hurry at all.
As long as she was happy, they would always be
satisfied.”
“Then why, might she ask, in such a hurry herself to leave them?”
“Oh!"
2997,"I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the
little white attic, near the old nurseries."
2998,"Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,
fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of
what they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would
scarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was
half-asleep; and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece’s
ill-humour, and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,
which were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say
no more."
2999,"“Then I will go after them,” said Catherine; “wherever they are I will
go after them."
3000,"""He is also handsome,"" replied Elizabeth, ""which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can."
3001,"You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these."
3002,"Let me never see either
one or the other again!""
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover."
3003,"These Tilneys seem to swallow up
everything else.”
Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind."
3004,"Your father is so very liberal!
He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to
promote the happiness of his children.” The brother and sister looked
at each other."
3005,"Do not you see
your aunt is going?
Quick, quick!
I cannot bear to keep good old Wilcox
waiting."
3006,"When she had been coming to Portsmouth, she had loved to call it her
home, had been fond of saying that she was going home; the word had
been very dear to her, and so it still was, but it must be applied to
Mansfield."
3007,"Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,
""Jane, I congratulate you."
3008,"We _seemed_ _very_ glad to see
each other, and I do really think we were a little."
3009,"Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere."
3010,"And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house."
3011,"Sir Thomas listened most politely,
but found much to offend his ideas of decorum, and confirm his
ill-opinion of Mr. Yates’s habits of thinking, from the beginning to
the end of the story; and when it was over, could give him no other
assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed."
3012,"She
felt it keenly.
They were now a miserable trio, confined within doors
by a series of rain and snow, with nothing to do and no variety to hope
for."
3013,"Another week, only one other
week, would have been enough for us."
3014,"Anxious not to appear unhappy, she soon recovered herself; and wiping
away her tears, was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of
his dress; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of
being on shore some part of every day before they sailed, and even of
getting her to Spithead to see the sloop."
3015,"Edmund had little to hope, but he was
still urging the subject when Henry Crawford entered the room, fresh
from the Parsonage, calling out, “No want of hands in our theatre, Miss
Bertram."
3016,"She became a subscriber; amazed
at being anything _in propria persona_, amazed at her own doings in
every way, to be a renter, a chuser of books!"
3017,"The wish of a numerous acquaintance
in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen, and she repeated it after
every fresh proof, which every morning brought, of her knowing nobody
at all."
3018,"""No, not at all.""
""What, none of you?"""
3019,"CHAPTER XVIII
Everything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and
dresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great
impediments arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was
not all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she
had not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had
been almost too much for her at first."
3020,"Accordingly, on this principle,
Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her, with a mild
gravity, intended to be overcoming, “Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr.
Crawford again, and learn from him exactly how matters stand between
you."
3021,"From this, she was preserved too by
another cause, by feeling no eagerness for her journey’s conclusion;
for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the
pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best, even after an absence
such as hers—an eleven weeks’ absence."
3022,"In
everything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictest
investigation.
It was done, and they were gone."
3023,"Their remoteness and
unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing
forth bitter lamentations.”
“I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort."
3024,"“It is not fair to urge her in
this manner.
You see she does not like to act."
3025,"It’s the best berth at Spithead.
But here is my sister, sir; here is
Fanny,” turning and leading her forward; “it is so dark you do not see
her.”
With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her, Mr. Price now
received his daughter; and having given her a cordial hug, and observed
that she was grown into a woman, and he supposed would be wanting a
husband soon, seemed very much inclined to forget her again."
3026,"If she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen."
3027,"Are you not
carried a little too far?
Would he thank you, either on his own account
or Miss Thorpe’s, for supposing that her affection, or at least her
good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain
Tilney?"
3028,"Every sort of exercise fatigues her so
soon, Miss Crawford, except riding.”
“How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all
last week!"
3029,"Fanny had not a word to say against its
becomingness, and, excepting what remained of her scruples, was
exceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos."
3030,"Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.
Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom."
3031,"Such a
victory over Edmund’s discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was
most delightful."
3032,"It is as true as that I sit here.
And had I
had an idea of it, nothing should have induced me to accept the
necklace."
3033,"No piece could be proposed that
did not supply somebody with a difficulty, and on one side or the other
it was a continual repetition of, “Oh no, _that_ will never do!"
3034,"One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself."
3035,"“My dear Miss Price,” said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at all
within hearing, “I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you
waiting; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself—I knew it
was very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if
you please, you must forgive me."
3036,"Ten to one but he
guesses the reason, and that is exactly what I want to avoid, so I
shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself.”
Isabella’s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend; she was
sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or
sister; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts."
3037,"With a look of much respect,
he immediately rose, and being introduced to her by her conscious
daughter as “Mr."
3038,"CHAPTER V.
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight."
3039,"Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!)
on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr."
3040,"The rest of the evening she found very dull; Mr.
Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea, to attend that of his
partner; Miss Tilney, though belonging to it, did not sit near her, and
James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the
latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile, one
squeeze, and one “dearest Catherine.”
CHAPTER 9
The progress of Catherine’s unhappiness from the events of the evening
was as follows."
3041,"She
expected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath,
and with a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, “Heyday!"
3042,"“The couple above, ma’am.
Do you see no symptoms there?”
“Oh dear!"
3043,"till she had made herself mistress of its contents,
however, she could have neither repose nor comfort; and with the sun’s
first rays she was determined to peruse it."
3044,"Her
cousins might attack, but could hardly tease her.
She was beyond their
reach; and if at last obliged to yield—no matter—it was all misery now."
3045,"Sir Thomas had been
quite indifferent to Mr. Crawford’s going or staying: but his good
wishes for Mr. Yates’s having a pleasant journey, as he walked with him
to the hall-door, were given with genuine satisfaction."
3046,"The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt."
3047,"The
pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in
fine weather I am out more than half my time."
3048,"""You are joking, Lizzy.
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy!"
3049,"But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife."
3050,"How I long to see her!
and to see dear Wickham too!
But the
clothes, the wedding clothes!"
3051,"He now wished it more than ever.
Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her."
3052,"You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street.”
“My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but,
however, speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring
business."
3053,"Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?""
""No really,"" replied Elizabeth; ""I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."""
3054,"At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration."
3055,"“Her mother is a very good sort of woman,” was Catherine’s answer."
3056,"Though _I_ have not seen much of the
domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any
deficiency of information.”
“Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are
condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information,
or (smiling) of something else."
3057,"When everything
was done they left the room, Catherine lingering only half a minute
behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well-known,
cherished object, and went down to the breakfast-parlour, where
breakfast was prepared."
3058,"_I_ do not subscribe to it.
I am sure
Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth."
3059,"He
yielded implicitly, and would fetch his hat and attend them in a
moment.” He left the room, and Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious
face, began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them
out of doors against his own inclination, under a mistaken idea of
pleasing her; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney’s saying, with a
little confusion, “I believe it will be wisest to take the morning
while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on my father’s account; he
always walks out at this time of day.”
Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood."
3060,"Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful."
3061,"Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.”
“Nay,” said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm."
3062,"At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.""
""That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,"" said Elizabeth."
3063,"“I wish you could see Compton,” said he; “it is the most complete
thing!"
3064,"The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention."
3065,"Susan was her only companion and listener on this, as on more common
occasions."
3066,"He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within."
3067,"I know
what you are thinking of.
You cannot suppose me uninformed."
3068,"By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken,
unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife, who was really extremely happy to
see him, and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to
place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years."
3069,"Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny.
Nay” (seeing her draw back displeased),
“forgive me."
3070,"Oo never saw a Crocodile so proud!
Why, it could go round and walk
on the top of its tail, and along its back, all the way to its head!"""
3071,"I said, as meekly as I could, that I didn't expect it, but it was the
only way of going to a dinner-party that I really enjoyed."
3072,"“As to fishes,” she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to Alice’s ear, “her White Majesty knows a lovely riddle—all in
poetry—all about fishes."
3073,"""But I mustn't
open the door for children.
D'you think I'd disobey the Rules?"
3074,"""He sold
his house, and he packed up his things, while the Lion were coming."
3075,"“Where do you come from?” said the Red Queen.
“And where are you going?"
3076,"I have a saddel—“Say’st thou soe?
Wyth styrruppes, Knyghte, to boote?”
   I sayde not that—I answere “Noe”—
      Yt lacketh such, I woote:
   Yt ys a mutton-saddel, loe!"
3077,"[Picture: He goes about and sits on folk]
   “The day he was elected Mayor
         I _know_ that every Sprite meant
   To vote for _me_, but did not dare—
   He was so frantic with despair
         And furious with excitement."
3078,"he insisted; and His Majesty begged.
""Paw!""
commanded Sylvie; and His
Majesty gave his paw."
3079,"'Farewell, farewell!
but this I tell
   To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!
He prayeth well, who loveth well
   Both man and bird and beast."
3080,"I
followed respectfully behind.
As we entered the breakfast-saloon, the Professor was saying ""--and he
had breakfast by himself, early: so he begged you wouldn't wait for him,
my Lady."
3081,"she earnestly exclaimed.
""Thank God!""
Arthur said to himself, but in so low a whisper that only
I heard it."
3082,"They sought and found undying fame:
      They toiled not for reward nor thanks:
   Their cheeks are hot with honest shame
      For you, the modern mountebanks!"
3083,"""Well then, I'll unkiss you!""
And he threw his arms round her neck for
this novel, but apparently not very painful, operation."
3084,"""The Queen will hear you!
You see she came rather late, and the
Queen said----""
""Get to your places!"""
3085,"“You won’t make yourself a bit realler by crying,” Tweedledee remarked:
“there’s nothing to cry about.”
“If I wasn’t real,” Alice said—half-laughing through her tears, it all
seemed so ridiculous—“I shouldn’t be able to cry.”
“I hope you don’t suppose those are real tears?” Tweedledum interrupted
in a tone of great contempt."
3086,"""You were asking--""
""We asked him to let us through the garden-door,"" said Sylvie: ""but he
wouldn't: but perhaps he would for you!"""
3087,"“I’m very glad I happened to be in the way,” Alice said, as she helped
her to put on her shawl again."
3088,"For the Earl had
caught the word and turned to listen.
""To each his sufferings, all are men,"" he replied in the sweet sad tones
that seemed natural to him: ""each has his pet aversion."""
3089,"The book should be handy in size with a pretty attractive
looking cover--in a clear legible type--and, above all, with abundance
of pictures, pictures, pictures!"
3090,"And you'd better get him to rub it in for you.
He's got rather cold hands, but you mustn't mind that."""
3091,"“And hear the sounds he knew of yore,
   Old shufflings on the sanded floor,
   Old knuckles tapping at the door?"
3092,"However, on the second time
round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!"
3093,"Sylvie, who hadn't quite lost her surprised look, put up her mouth for a
kiss."
3094,"Even the Professor and the children seemed to have lost
sight of me: and I stood in the midst of the group, as unconcernedly as
a ghost, seeing but unseen."
3095,"(He _called_ it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more
like a saucepan.)"
3096,"LIGHT COME, LIGHT GO.
Lady Muriel's smile of welcome could not quite conceal the look of
surprise with which she regarded my new companions."
3097,"""If it got very damp,"" Sylvie suggested, ""it might stick to something,
you know."""
3098,"""It's some hyaena--or other,"" replied the Sub-Warden, looking vaguely up
to the ceiling, as if that was where they usually were to be found."
3099,"“You can’t possibly do that,” said the Rose: “_I_ should advise you to
walk the other way.”
This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at
once towards the Red Queen."
3100,"What right have you to call yourself so?
You can’t
be a Queen, you know, till you’ve passed the proper examination."
3101,"He groaned, but instantly added, with a chuckle, ""As to
myself, I think you mentioned that I am--""
""Oo're the Professor!"""
3102,"""Indeed and indeed, Bruno, I didn't mean to grin.
See, I'm quite grave
again now."""
3103,"He's been curing himself, you
know: he's a very learned doctor."
3104,"said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her."
3105,"""You said I should hear all about it when the Warden had gone,"" she
remarked, as soon as she could make herself heard."
3106,"""I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,"" and she hurried out of the room."
3107,"""If you can,"" the Professor replied, cautiously.
""Let me try,"" said the Other Professor, seating himself at the
pianoforte."
3108,"""My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,"" said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, ""Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
all."
3109,"Mister Sir, doos oo know?""
""They're good for something,"" I said: ""even if we don't know what."
3110,"""Yes, please,"" said Sylvie, putting her hand into mine: and we walked
off together."
3111,"[Picture: The camera]
      This he perched upon a tripod—
   Crouched beneath its dusky cover—
   Stretched his hand, enforcing silence—
   Said, “Be motionless, I beg you!”
   Mystic, awful was the process."
3112,"""It was
to wash up the soup-plates--no, the cheese-plates I mean that was
grand enough."
3113,"“The Fourth prohibits trespassing
         Where other Ghosts are quartered:
   And those convicted of the thing
   (Unless when pardoned by the King)
         Must instantly be slaughtered."
3114,"Such, for example, was the last
line of 'The Hunting of the Snark,' which came into my head (as I have
already related in 'The Theatre' for April, 1887) quite suddenly, during
a solitary walk: and such, again, have been passages which occurred in
dreams, and which I cannot trace to any antecedent cause whatever."
3115,"""I quite forgot you didn't like cats.""
""Not like cats!"""
3116,"While she dissected, word by word,
   His speech, half guessed at and half heard,
   As might a cat a little bird."
3117,"sighed the Hatter.
""I told you butter would not suit
the works!"""
3118,"Said the
             mouse to
              the cur,
               'Such a
                trial, dear
                  sir, With
                   no jury
                     or judge,
                       would
                        be wast-
                       ing our
                      breath.'"
3119,"And
you, my darlings, must suffer it awhile, I fear.
Yet, when things are at
their worst, you can come to me."
3120,"“When I was
your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day."
3121,"However, _somebody_ killed _something_: that’s clear, at any rate—”
“But oh!” thought Alice, suddenly jumping up, “if I don’t make haste I
shall have to go back through the Looking-glass, before I’ve seen what
the rest of the house is like!"
3122,"I ventured on another question.
""But what became of the Man who said
'You may wait here till I come back'?"""
3123,"Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:
          ""I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
          How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie:
          The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
          While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat."
3124,"Do you think it’s going to
rain?”
Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and
looked up into it."
3125,"""I'm not going to question you,"" said the Earl: ""but there's no harm in
mentioning that Muriel is simply tormented with curiosity!"
3126,"""I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that!"

3128,"""Just think
what work it would make with the day and night!
You see the earth
takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis----""
""Talking of axes,"" said the Duchess, ""chop off her head."""
3129,"I said
'What for?'""
""She boxed the Queen's ears--"" the Rabbit began."
3130,"""What did oo begin wiz?""
Bruno asked, beginning to enter into the jest."
3131,"At last there
came an odd little twinkle into his eyes, and he said, with quite a new
meaning in his voice, ""That'll do nicely."
3132,"""Ye--es?""
she said dubiously.
""I don't seem to remember that so well."
3133,"""The
good I fancied I could do is vanished like a dream: the evil of this
troublesome world is the only abiding reality!"""
3134,"And here, with all
possible deference to Bruno as a Shakespearian critic, I must express my
opinion that the poet did not mean his three great tragic heroes to be
so strangely alike in their personal habits; nor do I believe that he
would have accepted the faculty of turning head-over-heels as any proof
at all of royal descent."
3135,"That's all.""
""Thank you,"" said Alice.
""It's very interesting."
3136,"shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began."
3137,"The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
""Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness."""
3138,"All
that is good, and living, and hopeful, rising with the dawn of Day!"
3139,"""He is very friendly, but I dare not
think he means more than that, as yet."
3140,"This seemed to be one of the difficult times: the Professor lifted him
up, once or twice, and shook him violently: but he always returned to
his book the moment he was let go of, and showed by his heavy breathing
that the book was as interesting as ever."
3141,"the young lady replied, with quivering lips
that would curve themselves into a smile, in spite of all her efforts to
look grave."
3142,"she said, warmly.
""He is so
passionately fond of Botany.
I'm afraid I know nothing of the theory
of it, but I keep his Hortus Siccus in order."
3143,"Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.
""What a
funny watch!"""
3144,"""Please, we want a little food, and a night's lodging--if
there's room in the house,"" she added timidly."
3145,"The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: ""There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you!"
3146,"But, when he's
extremely sober (that's the other extreme), he sees two things as one."
3147,"""Where will the Ball come in?""
said the Other Professor.
""I think it had better come at the beginning of the Banquet--it brings
people together so nicely, you know."""
3148,"{Image...He thought he saw an albatross}
""Would it be afraid of catching cold?"""
3149,"Would you tell me, please?”
But the little men only looked at each other and grinned."
3150,"And when you'd lost your little all,
    And found yourself a thing despised,
    I need not ask you to recall
    How tenderly I sympathised!"
3151,"I can't
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit."""
3152,"""I'm not good company to-night--better be
alone.""
It was much the same, next day."
3153,"""You are old,"" said the youth, ""one would hardly suppose
            That your eye was as steady as ever;
          Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
            What made you so awfully clever?"""
3154,"', seemed quite
sufficient by way of verbal direction: the lion at once broke into an
easy canter, and we soon found ourselves in the depths of the forest."
3155,"“Which door?” said the Frog.
Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he
spoke."
3156,"""What for?""
said the one who had first spoken.
""That's none of _your_ business, Two!"""
3157,"Very well then,
oo put one foot here, and one foot here, so oo doosn't tread on the
Fairy."""
3158,"Just like a
whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender!
And how quiet the
horses are!"
3159,"She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once."
3160,"""Now just
try.
I've often amused myself that way.
Consider this platform as
our stage."
3161,"""All right, so far,"" said the King, as he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: ""'_We know it to be true_--' that's the jury, of
course--'_If she should push the matter on_'--that must be the
Queen--'_What would become of you?_'--What, indeed!--'_I gave her one,
they gave him two_--' why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you
know----""
""But it goes on '_they all returned from him to you_,'"" said Alice."
3162,"After that old beggar again?""
the Gardener yelled, and began
singing:--
    ""He thought he saw a Kangaroo
    That worked a coffee-mill:
    He looked again, and found it was
    A Vegetable-pill
    'Were I to swallow this,' he said,
    'I should be very ill!'"""
3163,"Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again,
as if it had been only yesterday—the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of
the Knight—the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on
his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her—the horse quietly
moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the
grass at her feet—and the black shadows of the forest behind—all this
she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she
leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a
half dream, to the melancholy music of the song."
3164,"Sylvie entreated with tears in her eyes.
""Well, well!""
said the good-natured old man."
3165,"""I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears!"
3166,"""Let's hear that bit of the letter again,"" said my Lady."
3167,"“For ten lang years, O weary hours!
I coorted thee by signs;
   By sending game, by sending flowers,
      By sending Valentines."
3168,"The old Beggar must have been very deaf, as he paid no attention
whatever to Bruno's eager shouting, but trudged wearily on, never
pausing until the child got in front of him and held up the slice of
cake."
3169,"""I ca'n't, and I won't!""
Sylvie exclaimed, the moment he reappeared."
3170,"""What _is_ the fun?""
""Why, _she_,"" said the Gryphon."
3171,"Secondly, a book of pieces selected from the Bible--not single texts,
but passages of from 10 to 20 verses each--to be committed to memory."
3172,"You might have seen, with half an eye,"" he added, ""that
that's his line."
3173,"“Now thirty years are gane and past,
      I am come frae a foreign land:
   I am come to tell thee my love at last—
      O Ladye, gie me thy hand!”
   The ladye she turned not pale nor red,
      But she smiled a pitiful smile:
   “Sic’ a coortin’ as yours, my man,” she said
      “Takes a lang and a weary while!”
               [Picture: And out and laughed the popinjay]
   And out and laughed the popinjay,
      A laugh of bitter scorn:
   “A coortin’ done in sic’ a way,
      It ought not to be borne!”
   Wi’ that the doggie barked aloud,
      And up and doon he ran,
   And tugged and strained his chain o’ gowd,
      All for to bite the man."
3174,"I felt no inclination to call
by myself at the Hall; still less to propose that Arthur should go
with me: it seemed better to wait till Time--that gentle healer of our
bitterest sorrows should have helped him to recover from the first shock
of the disappointment that had blighted his life."
3175,"""It's Bruno that's crying: and he's my brother: and, please, we both
want to go: he ca'n't walk, you know: he's--he's dreaming, you know""
(this in a whisper, for fear of hurting my feelings)."
3176,"“Why all round her head, of course,” the Rose replied."
3177,"he added wildly, turning round and round like a
teetotum.
Help to look for him!"
3178,"and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--
          ""Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
              Beautiful, beautiful Soup!"""
3179,"At length the curtain rose upon
      ‘Bombastes Furioso.’
   In vain we roared; in vain we tried
      To rouse her into laughter:
   Her pensive glances wandered wide
      From orchestra to rafter—
   “_Tier upon tier_!” she said, and sighed;
      And silence followed after."
3180,"""Oh, but it did though!""
Bruno put in eagerly.
""It were proud of its new
tail!"
3181,"Bruno hastily went round to Sylvie, who was standing at the other side
of the Professor, and put his hand into hers."
3182,"""I'll just--sit down a moment--"" he said dreamily:
""--where's Sylvie?"""
3183,"I know I should!""
""You appear to be talking to somebody--that isn't here,"" the Professor
said, turning round to the children."
3184,"To-morrow morning you shall have a
real treat.
All the time you’re eating your breakfast, I’ll repeat ‘The
Walrus and the Carpenter’ to you; and then you can make believe it’s
oysters, dear!"
3185,"I've showed it all
the duck-weeds--and a live caddis-worm----but it won't say nuffin!"
3186,"“You like poetry?”
“Ye-es, pretty well—_some_ poetry,” Alice said doubtfully."
3187,"""Look Eastward!
Aye, look Eastward!""
One little picture in this book, the Magic Locket, at p. 77, was drawn
by 'Miss Alice Havers.'"
3188,"""Human
Free-Will is an exception to the system of fixed Law.
Eric said
something like that."
3189,"And stones aren't
pretty, one bit.
Would oo like some dindledums, Mister Sir?"""
3190,"And after that--""
""Don't puzzle the child so!""
Lady Muriel interrupted."
3191,"Would you call that a tune, Professor?""
he asked, when he had finished."
3192,"She felt as if she would
never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and
still the Queen cried “Faster!"
3193,"The next question is, what is the best time for seeing Fairies?
I
believe I can tell you all about that."
3194,"I muttered to
myself with some bitterness.
""And this is, of course, the opening
scene of Vol."
3195,"May I go and put
them on directly?""
""Well, not just yet, Lovey,"" her husband uneasily replied."
3196,"Looking-Glass Insects
Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the
country she was going to travel through."
3197,"""Ah!""
said my Lady, graciously smiling on that high official."
3198,"Left to myself, I felt the 'eerie' feeling rush over me again, and saw,
standing at the door of Number Forty, the three figures I knew so well."
3199,"""I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!"""
3200,"Alice folded her hands, and began:--
          ""You are old, Father William,"" the young man said,
            ""And your hair has become very white;
          And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
            Do you think, at your age, it is right?"""
3201,"I have said 'passages,' rather than single texts, because we have no
means of recalling single texts: memory needs links, and here are none:
one may have a hundred texts stored in the memory, and not be able
to recall, at will, more than half-a-dozen--and those by mere chance:
whereas, once get hold of any portion of a chapter that has been
committed to memory, and the whole can be recovered: all hangs together."
3202,"""How many hare-bells would oo like?""
And he put his thumb into his
mouth to help me to consider."
3203,"As soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside."
3204,"His Majesty
exclaimed.
""They must be curious creatures!
I must have a look at them!"""
3205,"“If I
only knew,” she thought to herself, “which was neck and which was
waist!”
Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a
minute or two."
3206,"""I'm looking for Vol.
Three,"" he said.
""Do you happen to have
seen it?"""
3207,"“Tell him you’ll stand no sort of trick;
         Then, if he leers and chuckles,
   You just be handy with a stick
   (Mind that it’s pretty hard and thick)
         And rap him on the knuckles!"
3208,"[Picture: Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab]
      Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab:
   He suggested curves of beauty,
   Curves pervading all his figure,
   Which the eye might follow onward,
   Till they centered in the breast-pin,
   Centered in the golden breast-pin."
3209,"It is the word
'exilium' in the well-known passage
    Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium

3210,"""And there will really be a Vice after all?""
my Lady enquired."
3211,"Bruno jumped, and clapped his hands.
""That are nice!""
""Aren't
it, Sylvie?"""
3212,"""I'm afraid I don't know one,"" said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal."
3213,"Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria--'""
""Ugh!"""
3214,"""My ancestors were all
famous for military genius.""
My Lady smiled graciously."
3215,"“Thank you very much,” she whispered in reply, “but I can do quite well
without.”
“That wouldn’t be at all the thing,” the Red Queen said very decidedly:
so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace."
3216,"""The A.T.

bag--and there you are!"""
3217,"“No, you oughtn’t: that’s quite another thing!"
3218,"I can see all of it when I get upon a
chair—all but the bit behind the fireplace."
3219,"Here I broke in—“Inspector who?
Inspecting Ghosts is something new!
Explain yourself, my man!”
   “His name is Kobold,” said my guest:
         “One of the Spectre order:
   You’ll very often see him dressed
   In a yellow gown, a crimson vest,
         And a night-cap with a border."
3220,"And, instead of being pleased with the
compliment, the spiteful little thing has gone away in a huff!"""
3221,"""This one did,"" said Bruno.
""And its mouth were like a large cupboard."
3222,"Bruno took it from him with great decision.
""Beg for it!"""
3223,"""Oh, of course.
I forgot,"" said Sylvie.
""Bruno--Esquire!"""
3224,"When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,
          As the word was so puzzling to spell;
     But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn’t mind
          Undertaking that duty as well."
3225,"""But who is to give the prizes?""
quite a chorus of voices asked."
3226,"Is that queer _thing_ supposed to burn?
(It’s far too dismal a concern
         To call a Moderator)."
3227,"Only I think it must have
been raining a little just then, for I found a drop or two on my cheeks."

3229,"I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and
yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life!"
3230,"""One can easily imagine a situation,"" said Arthur, ""where things would
necessarily have no weight, relatively to each other, though each would
have its usual weight, looked at by itself."""
3231,"""What I wanted to tell you was this,"" he resumed.
""I heard this evening
from my solicitor."
3232,"“I only wish _I_ had such eyes,” the King remarked in a fretful tone."
3233,"Yes, to him this present life--spite of all its weariness and all its
sorrow--was the only life worth having: all else was 'exile'!"
3234,"The Queen!""
and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces."
3235,"No repetition!""
It really was admirable, as soon as I began to enter into it from this
point of view."

3241,"Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating ""_You are old, Father William_,"" to the Caterpillar, and
the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long
breath, and said, ""That's very curious."""

3245,"""But they were _in_ the well,"" Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last remark."

on it."
3247,"Let's try and find some--""
But Sylvie was not satisfied yet."

with enthusiasm, ""but he needs a man like your Lordship to draw him

surprise."
3252,"The Professor referred to a card he held in his hand.
""His Adiposity the

3253,"Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily engaged in stirring the soup, and did
not seem to be listening, so she ventured to go on again: ""Twenty-four
hours, I _think_; or is it twelve?"
3254,"Which do _you_ think it was?
A boat beneath a sunny sky,
Lingering onward dreamily
In an evening of July—
Children three that nestle near,
Eager eye and willing ear,
Pleased a simple tale to hear—
Long has paled that sunny sky:
Echoes fade and memories die."
3255,"(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily

you over.
It would be a pity to go by rail----there is so much pretty
scenery on the road."
3257,"However, there would
be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over."

Sylvie whispered,
with her arms round his neck; and she kissed away a tear that was
trickling down his cheek."
3259,"While arranging
the 'slips' into pages, I found that the passage, whichnow extends
from the top of p. 35 to the middle of p. 38, was 3 lines too short."

sighing."
3262,"“It’s _very_ provoking,” Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence,

Yes, we were in the garden once more: and, to escape that horrid
discordant voice, we hurried indoors, and found ourselves in the
library--Uggug blubbering, the Professor standing by with a bewildered
air, and my Lady, with her arms clasped round her son's neck, repeating,
over and over again, ""and did they give him nasty lessons to learn?"
3292,"We go to entertainments, such as the theatre--I say 'we', for I also
go to the play, whenever I get a chance of seeing a really good one and
keep at arm's length, if possible, the thought that we may not return
alive."
3293,"""Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?""
said the Gryphon."
3294,"I’m sure it’s got, oh!
such beautiful things in
it!"
3295,"""Consider your
verdict,"" he said to the jury, in a low trembling voice."
3296,"Rub
as she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little
dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her
was an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and
then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles."
3297,"But I want you to come too.""
""Let me go with you,"" I pleaded."
3298,"""He's not afraid of them, you know.
But he doesn't like them."
3299,"""I've heard something like it,"" said Alice.
""It goes on, you know,"" the Hatter continued, ""in this way:--
          'Up above the world you fly,
          Like a tea-tray in the sky."
3300,"I exclaimed earnestly.
And indeed I felt as if one could
not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice."
3301,"""Turn to the left!""
cried the Vice-Warden, hastily stepping forwards to
show the way---so hastily, that he ran against his unfortunate guest,
who fell heavily on his face."
3302,"She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate."
3303,"But, if we were all falling
together, it couldn't be trying to fall any quicker, you know: for, if
I let go, what more could it do than fall?"
3304,"Which contain the greatest amount of Science, do you
think, the books, or the minds?"""
3305,"""That won't be no good at all!""
said Bruno, who was waiting for us in
the garden."
3306,"""But, Doctor!""
""Society doesn't 'receive' three times a
day!"""
3307,"That
casual observer would have been mistaken.
""Ah, she'll like 'em, I war'n' ye!"
3308,"all the time.
""Isn't it
wonderful that he should be so dreamy?"""
3309,"To bring out even that one word seemed a gigantic
effort: but, the cry once uttered, all effort ceased at once: a sudden
gust swept away the whole scene, and I found myself sitting up, staring
at the young lady in the opposite corner of the carriage, who had now
thrown back her veil, and was looking at me with an expression of amused
surprise."
3310,"""Pardon me,"" said the Professor.
""This particular kind of bath is
not adapted for a flea."
3311,"""Doos oo know where
Sylvie is?
I's looking for Sylvie!"""
3312,"“I’ll tell you how I came to think of it,” said the Knight."
3313,"""No, they're not,"" said the White Rabbit, ""and that's the queerest thing
about it."""
3314,"""We've been there just twenty minutes,"" he
said, ""and I've done nothing but listen to you and Lady Muriel talking:
and yet, somehow, I feel exactly as if I had been talking with her for
an hour at least!"""
3315,"""Oh, more than that!""
the Professor exclaimed.
""A fortnight, sometimes."
3316,"---- so long as I get _somewhere_,"" Alice added as an explanation."
3317,"""I should like it very much,"" said Alice, ""but I haven't been invited
yet."""
3318,"The further off from England the nearer is to France--
  Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance."
3319,"""Give your evidence,"" said the King; ""and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot."""
3320,"or, ""Off with her
             head!""
116
          The Mock Turtle drew a long breath and
             said, ""That's very curious""               132
          Who stole the Tarts?"
3321,"“And sit down, both of you,” (to the King
and the Unicorn): “fair play with the cake, you know!”
The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him."
3322,"""You have struck quite a new vein,"" I said.
""To most of us Life and its
pleasures seem like a mine that is nearly worked out."""
3323,"[Illustration]
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit."
3324,"Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper!""
""Hold your tongue, Ma!"""
3325,"“The duck was tender, but the peas
         Were very much too old:
   And just remember, if you please,
   The _next_ time you have toasted cheese,
         Don’t let them send it cold."
3326,"She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: ""Where's the other
ladder?--Why I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!"
3327,"So she got up, and held out her hand.
“Good-bye, till we meet
again!” she said as cheerfully as she could."
3328,"The Professor held his head between his hands--an attitude that I knew
indicated distraction of mind."
3329,"None, I think, but an idiot could—
      Or one that loved the Sea."
3330,"""Why?""
""_It does the boots and shoes_,"" the Gryphon replied very solemnly."
3331,"Closing one's eyelids, when something
seems to be flying into the eye, is one of those actions, and saying
""May I carry the little girl up the stairs?"""
3332,"""Oo're big enough to be two Dukes,"" said the little creature."
3333,"The Warden, a tall dignified man with a grave but very pleasant face,
was seated before a writing-table, which was covered with papers, and
holding on his knee one of the sweetest and loveliest little maidens it
has ever been my lot to see."
3334,"But I should have
enough for both, even if health failed.""
""I wish you all happiness in your married life!"""
3335,"She says 'It isn't ca'n't, it's wo'n't!'""
""Let's go and see the Professor,"" the Warden said, wisely avoiding
further discussion."
3336,"Alice felt there was no denying _that_.
“Of course it would be all the
better,” she said: “but it wouldn’t be all the better his being
punished.”
“You’re wrong _there_, at any rate,” said the Queen: “were _you_ ever
punished?”
“Only for faults,” said Alice."
3337,"""Don't buy it!""
was Her Majesty's edict as she looked down, with a lofty
scorn that seemed curiously mixed with tender interest, on the ragged
creature at her feet."
3338,"It would hurt him to be divided.""
This remark woke up Bruno, suddenly and completely."
3339,"A child's sorrow is violent but short; and it was almost in her usual
voice that she said after a minute ""Oh stop stop!"
3340,"The instantaneous change
was startling: the two figures seemed to flash back into their former
places.
"""
3341,"“I
can’t remember here.”
So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped
lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into
another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,
and shook itself free from Alice’s arms."
3342,"She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort."
3343,"Which way is it, Professor?
Up or down?""
""Neither!"""
3344,"Five growing girls, from Fifteen to Eleven:
   Music, Drawing, Languages, and food enough for seven!"
3345,"Each seated on his favourite post,
   We chumped and chawed the buttered toast
         They gave us for our tea.”
           [Picture: We chumped and chawed the buttered toast]
   “That story is in print!” I cried."
3346,"But now as to the relative weight of things.
Nothing can be
heavy, you know, except by trying to fall, and being prevented from
doing so."
3347,"Till the feast’s ready, we’ve time for a nap:
When the feast’s over, we’ll go to the ball—
Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!"
3348,"The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not
becoming."
3349,"""It isn't very beautiful,"" Sylvie said, hesitatingly.
""It's very extremely ugly!"""
3350,"I
never saw one alive before!”
“Well, now that we _have_ seen each other,” said the Unicorn, “if
you’ll believe in me, I’ll believe in you."
3351,"“Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate—would
you like to hear it?”
“Very much indeed,” Alice said politely."
3352,"""You'll know directly!""
cried Sylvie, as she adjusted two or three young
Frogs that had struggled round with their backs to the stage."
3353,"A word in your ear!""
The rest of their conversation was all in whispers: so, as I could hear
no more, I thought I would go and find Bruno."
3354,"""Why did it stay in?""
Her function seemed to be much the
same as that of the Chorus in a Greek Play: she had to encourage the
orator, and draw him out, by a series of intelligent questions."
3355,"I pressed the 'reversal-peg' and
walked in.
In another house, the entrance of a stranger might cause
surprise--perhaps anger, even going so far as to expel the said stranger
with violence: but here, I knew, nothing of the sort could happen."
3356,"“You’ve only a few yards to go,” he said, “down the hill and over
that little brook, and then you’ll be a Queen—But you’ll stay and see
me off first?” he added as Alice turned with an eager look in the
direction to which he pointed."
3357,"Then you think,"" I continued aloud, ""that
we ought sometimes to ask a Ghost to sit down?"
3358,"But, if it is your
difficulty,"" (his voice unconsciously took a tenderer tone) ""then I will
speak."""
3359,"Think of any pretty little boy you know, with rosy cheeks, large dark
eyes, and tangled brown hair, and then fancy him made small enough to go
comfortably into a coffee-cup, and you'll have a very fair idea of him."
3360,"The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.
""Never heard of
uglifying!"""
3361,"So, as I was saying, I had gone down upon one knee, and was just
reaching out a little stick to turn the Beetle over, when I saw a sight
that made me draw back hastily and hold my breath, for fear of making
any noise and frightening the little creature a way."
3362,"""Now I'll manage better this time,"" she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden."
3363,"I--I--scarcely comprehend!""
""Well, the length, breadth, and thickness, if you like it better!"""
3364,"""Rub it some other way!""
""Try up-and-down!
It was a happy thought."
3365,"""What are its lizard
bandages?'
""Well, this is one of them,"" said the Professor."
3366,"“How
many days are there in a year?”
“Three hundred and sixty-five,” said Alice."
3367,"said the young Crab, a little
snappishly.
""You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!"""
3368,"The twilight wanes, and morning comes at last—
            “Oh, Uncle, what’s o’clock?”
   The Uncle gravely nods, and wisely winks."
3369,"Not even a crust!""
""Poor, poor old man!""
exclaimed a little voice at my side, half choked
with sobs."
3370,"But, once realise what the true object is in life--that it is not
pleasure, not knowledge, not even fame itself, 'that last infirmity of
noble minds'--but that it is the development of character, the rising
to a higher, nobler, purer standard, the building-up of the perfect
Man--and then, so long as we feel that this is going on, and will (we
trust) go on for evermore, death has for us no terror; it is not a
shadow, but a light; not an end, but a beginning!"
3371,"The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen, “I invite
you to Alice’s dinner-party this afternoon.”
The White Queen smiled feebly, and said “And I invite _you_.”
“I didn’t know I was to have a party at all,” said Alice; “but if there
is to be one, I think _I_ ought to invite the guests.”
“We gave you the opportunity of doing it,” the Red Queen remarked: “but
I daresay you’ve not had many lessons in manners yet?”
“Manners are not taught in lessons,” said Alice."
3372,"But they haven't touched it.
Perhaps they caught sight of
another, and left it to die of fright and exhaustion."""
3373,"Surely the grandeur of a mountain, to me,
depends on its size, relative to me?"
3374,"""On my birthday,"" my Lady concluded in a meek whisper.
""One must have a
dagger, you know."
3375,"But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered
in her ear, “Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a
return-ticket every time the train stops.”
“Indeed I shan’t!” Alice said rather impatiently."
3376,"“I should think throwing cold water over you would be better,” Alice
suggested: “or some sal-volatile.”
“I didn’t say there was nothing _better_,” the King replied."
3377,"I took a kettle large and new,
Fit for the deed I had to do."
3378,"And he was followed,
in his turn, by a frightened little nursemaid, carrying a fat baby, also
screaming."
3379,"""And washing?""
said the Mock Turtle.
""Certainly not!"""
3380,"Why, if he'd had a toofache, a course he'd
have held his head down--like this--and he'd have put a lot of warm
blankets round it!"""
3381,"And it only cost fourpence-halfpenny!""
""Thank you, it's very pretty!"""
3382,"""My dear,"" he said, ""is that a pig that I see down
below, rooting about among your flower-beds?"""
3383,"‘O Oysters, come and walk with us!’
    The Walrus did beseech."
3384,"Sylvie looked at me with twinkling eyes.
""You dear old thing!"""
3385,"Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!""
And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them."
3386,"the Gardener shouted, as he hurled the watering-can
across the flower-bed, and produced a handful of keys--one large one,
and a number of small ones."
3387,"He's getting awfully strict!""
This reminded the poor children of all the troubles, about which they
had come to their old friend."
3388,"“There’s nothing
like eating hay when you’re faint,” he remarked to her, as he munched
away."
3389,"But to me they are real.""
Bruno looked puzzled.
""I'll try anuvver kind of fruits!"""
3390,"QUEER STREET, NUMBER FORTY.
Lady Muriel was the speaker.
And, for the moment, that was the only fact
I could clearly realise."
3391,"Bruno had to put his thumb in his mouth and consider a little before he
could answer."
3392,"""Only mustard isn't a bird,"" Alice remarked.
""Right, as usual,"" said the Duchess: ""what a clear way you have of
putting things!"""
3393,"He's
getting his Lecture ready.
So he has to stay at home."""
3394,"Please, dear Child,
help again!
""I don't believe no Crocodile never walked along its own forehead!"""
3395,"They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman
about it--he would only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in
pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been
able to understand--so it generally ended in its being fastened on,
anyhow, across the rudder."
3396,"And I haven’t sent
the two Messengers, either.
They’re both gone to the town."
3397,"On every tree
    What lamps are shining, ting, ting, ting!
They are eyes of fiery flies
    To light our dining, ting, ting, ting!"
3398,"Against God's Spirit he lies; quite stops
   Mercy with insult; dares, and drops,
   Like a scorch'd fly, that spins in vain
   Upon the axis of its pain,
   Then takes its doom, to limp and crawl,
   Blind and forgot, from fall to fall."""
3399,"But here we
plunged into a tunnel, and I leaned back and closed my eyes for a
moment, trying to recall a few of the incidents of my recent dream."
3400,"was written after seeing Miss Marion Terry perform in Mr.
Gilbert’s play of “Pygmalion and Galatea.”  The three stanzas
respectively describe “My First,” “My Second,” and “My Whole.”]
                                      I
   THERE was an ancient City, stricken down
      With a strange frenzy, and for many a day
   They paced from morn to eve the crowded town,
            And danced the night away."
3401,"""A welly curious machine,"" Bruno broke in, not at all willing to
have the story thus taken out of his mouth, ""and if oo puts
in--some-finoruvver--at one end, oo know and he turns the handle--and it
comes out at the uvver end, oh, ever so short!"""
3402,"And then, when it's dirty all
over--so--"" (he passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks as he spoke)
""then she washes it."""
3403,"""Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?""
asked another of the jurymen."
3404,"Sylvie laughed merrily.
""What do you mean?""
And she pushed
back her heavy brown hair with both hands, and looked at him with
dancing eyes in which the big teardrops were still glittering."
3405,"""This was followed by a cold dinner at 1 (servants to have no work),
Sunday-School again from 2 to 4, and Evening-Service at 6."
3406,"[Illustration]
""Cheshire Puss,"" she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider."
3407,"""Seven jogged my
elbow.""
On which Seven looked up and said, ""That's right, Five!"
3408,"Is it--is it--her voice dropped to an awestruck
whisper, is it dead, do you think?"""
3409,"But the snail replied: ""Too far, too far!""
and gave a look askance--
  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance."
3410,"""How perfectly isochronous!""
the Professor exclaimed with enthusiasm.
He had his watch in his hand, and was carefully counting Bruno's
oscillations."
3411,"And I said to myself ""That's very strange.""
I quite thought it was
Lady Muriel talking to me."
3412,"“The dog would lose its temper,
wouldn’t it?”
“Perhaps it would,” Alice replied cautiously."
3413,"Contrariwise.”
“Selfish things!” thought Alice, and she was just going to say
“Good-night” and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under the
umbrella and seized her by the wrist."
3414,"The confusion got worse every moment, and Alice was
very glad to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found
the White King seated on the ground, busily writing in his
memorandum-book."
3415,"“If only you’d spoken before!
It’s excessively awkward to mention it now,
          With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!"
3416,"So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly."
3417,"and then paused,
as if to consider how this could best be proved."
3418,"To the horror of all who were present that day.
He uprose in full evening dress,
     And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say
          What his tongue could no longer express."
3419,"Throwing away the spade, he broke into a frantic jig, snapping his
fingers, and repeating, again and again,
    ""There won't be much for us!"
3420,"The last of the crew needs especial remark,
          Though he looked an incredible dunce:
     He had just one idea--but, that one being “Snark,”
           The good Bellman engaged him at once."
3421,"""I remember that word now.
And they
produce--?""
""A Delusion,"" said Arthur."
3422,"For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, “I really
_shall_ do it this time—” when the path gave a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door."
3423,"“You must know--” said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed “Fudge!”
           That statute is obsolete quite!"
3424,"“I meant the other way.”
“It’s too late to correct it,” said the Red Queen: “when you’ve once
said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.”
“Which reminds me—” the White Queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands, “we had _such_ a thunderstorm last
Tuesday—I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you know.”
Alice was puzzled."
3425,"""Nonsense!""
said Sylvie very decidedly: and gave their names in Doggee."
3426,"he proclaimed, with a sudden change of
tone.
""Lights turned up."
3427,"This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass."
3428,"{Image...A bear without a head}
""No, I ca'n't let you out again!"""
3429,"And the croaking ceased at once.
Shakespeare has not told us, so far as I know, that Macbeth had any such
eccentric habit as turning head-over-heels in private life: but Bruno
evidently considered it quite an essential part of the character, and
left the stage in a series of somersaults."
3430,"“O didna ye get the rings, Ladye,
      The rings o’ the gowd sae fine?"
3431,"The first two stanzas describe the two main words, and each
subsequent stanza one of the cross “lights.”
No."
3432,"Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?""
(and she
tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy _curtseying_ as you're falling
through the air!"
3433,"I’ll just call and say ‘how d’you do?’ and ask them the way out of the
wood."
3434,"And she led him
out of the room, unnoticed by the rest of the party, who were wholly
absorbed in watching the old Beggar."
3435,"The words
sounded harsh: but the tone was gentleness itself.
""He's an idle little
boy!"""
3436,"The little fishes’ answer was
‘We cannot do it, Sir, because—’”
“I’m afraid I don’t quite understand,” said Alice."
3437,"But four young oysters hurried up,
    All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
    Their shoes were clean and neat—
And this was odd, because, you know,
    They hadn’t any feet."
3438,"""Is this a dagger?""
Macbeth inquired, in a
puzzled sort of tone: and instantly a chorus of ""Thorn!"
3439,"the Vice-Warden interrupted.
""Your position, as
Court-Professor, makes it awkward, I admit."
3440,"“Now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!”
“Then I hope your finger is better now?” Alice said very politely, as
she crossed the little brook after the Queen."
3441,"Each of them threaded her needle with a short end of thread
attached to the work, which was instantly pulled by an invisible force
through the stuff, dragging the needle after it: the nimble fingers of
the little sempstress caught it at the other side, but only to lose it
again the next moment."
3442,"He drew the curtains again, and we returned to our places by the
fireside."
3443,"The Beetle tried and, I suppose, succeeded.
""Yes, that's right."
3444,"""A development worthy of Darwin!
"", the lady exclaimed enthusiastically.
""Only you reverse his theory."
3445,"“To dine!” she shrieked in dragon-wrath.
“To swallow wines all foam and froth!"
3446,"The Vice-Warden resumed the thread of his discourse.
""The reason I
mentioned it, Professor, was to ask you to be so kind as to preside at
the Election."
3447,"Sylvie drew back
hastily, with an offended air: but in another moment, with a glad cry of
""Why, it's Father!"
3448,"{Image...'What a game!'}
The three waited in silence till the sound of wheels announced that the
Warden was out of hearing: then, to my surprise, they broke into peals
of uncontrollable laughter."
3449,"“And
then he took the helmet off again—but it took hours and hours to get me
out."
3450,"He is not guileless, and he is not a
peasant--but I don't know that either point is of vital importance."""
3451,"""Eat, and don't cry!""
were her short and simple
orders: and the poor children sat down side by side, but seemed in no
mood for eating."
3452,"When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse, it
always touched the ground directly."
3453,"""I dare not ask the question whether there is another!""
he said
passionately."
3454,"“I always do,” said the Red Knight, and they began banging away at each
other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way
of the blows."
3455,"I
am bound to admit,"" the Professor continued, in a lower tone and with
downcast eyes, ""that we need a man of remarkable strength."
3456,"Go
instead and take a seat in a third-class railway-carriage, and you'll
get the same dialogue done to the life!"
3457,"“It’ll never do to go down among them
without a good long branch to brush them away—and what fun it’ll be
when they ask me how I like my walk."
3458,"""_That_ you won't"" thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air."
3459,"That is binding on us as Theists.
Secondly, we have the fact that 'the Lord's Day' is a Christian
institution."
3460,"But the children still kept fast hold of his hands.
""Do come with us!"""
3461,"{Image...Boots for horizontal weather}
""But what's the use of wearing umbrellas round one's knees?"""
3462,"But do cats eat bats, I wonder?""
And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, ""Do cats eat bats?"
3463,"""Now is my time!""
I said to myself, as I moved back the hand of the
Watch, and saw, almost without surprise this time, all things restored
to the places they had occupied at the critical moment when I had first
noticed the fallen packing-case."
3464,"And he must have known their great value--they are simply
priceless!"""
3465,"{Image...'Hammer it in!'}
Then his father turned to the 'shaving' scene which was being enacted,
and roared with laughter."
3466,"But this
isn't the Sabbath-Day.
The Sabbath-day has ceased to exist."""
3467,"""I daresay you never spoke to Time!""
""Perhaps not,"" Alice cautiously replied: ""but I know I have to beat time
when I learn music."""
3468,"Queens have to be dignified, you know!”
So she got up and walked about—rather stiffly just at first, as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with
the thought that there was nobody to see her, “and if I really am a
Queen,” she said as she sat down again, “I shall be able to manage it
quite well in time.”
Everything was happening so oddly that she didn’t feel a bit surprised
at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there, but she feared it would not be quite civil."
3469,"""Was he your brother yesterday?""
the Gardener anxiously enquired.
""Course I were!"""
3470,"In
fact, he climbed up into Sylvie's lap as he spoke, and rested his head
against her shoulder."
3471,"""Come on then,"" said the Queen, ""and he shall tell you his history."""
3472,"'Draws well?'
you repeat thoughtfully.
That's the way to become a great critic!"""
3473,"Nature is one thing.
Art is another.
Nature shows
us the world as it is."
3474,"Why, his
time is worth a thousand pounds a minute!”
“I’m afraid I haven’t got one,” Alice said in a frightened tone: “there
wasn’t a ticket-office where I came from.” And again the chorus of
voices went on."
3475,"Alice called after it.
And the
others all joined in chorus, ""Yes, please do!"""
3476,"For instance, the human race has one kind of
shape--bipeds.
Another set, ranging from the lion to the mouse, are
quadrupeds."
3477,"one of them
was saying: and so the whole dialogue was repeated, and, when they
had parted for the second time, I let them go their several ways, and
strolled on through the town."
3478,"The question is, what did the
archbishop find?""
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, ""'--found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown."
3479,"""But,"" with an evident wish to avoid a
possibly painful topic, ""one needn't be either, to take an interest in
books of Science."
3480,"“It isn’t
very likely there would be any mice on the horse’s back.”
“Not very likely, perhaps,” said the Knight: “but if they _do_ come, I
don’t choose to have them running all about.”
“You see,” he went on after a pause, “it’s as well to be provided for
_everything_."
3481,"And
he went and he lived in another town.
So the Lion ate the wrong man."""
3482,"So, having no reply to give
    To what the old man said,
I cried, ‘Come, tell me how you live!’
    And thumped him on the head."
3483,"""No, I don't!""
she said with a smile.
""Do you?"""
3484,"said the Other Professor, who had been standing with his back to us all
this time, occupying himself in taking the books out, one by one, and
turning them upside-down."
3485,"In a moment Sylvie and Bruno
were gone again, and I could just see them in the far distance, picking
'dindledums.'"
3486,"You have seen people eating cherry-tart, and every now and then
cautiously conveying a cherry-stone from their lips to their plates?"
3487,"You'll remember how to use it?""
""Yes, I'll remember,"" said Sylvie."
3488,"Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:
          A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
     That frequently happens in tropical climes,
          When a vessel is, so to speak, “snarked.”
     But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,
          And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
     Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,
          That the ship would not travel due West!"
3489,"""From bad to worse!""
the old man said to himself, dreamily, when the
children had finished their rather confused account of the Ambassador's
visit, gathered no doubt from general report, as they had not seen him
themselves."
3490,"Five rosy girls, in years from Ten to Six:
   Sitting down to lessons—no more time for tricks."
3491,"""I should like to have it explained,"" said the Mock Turtle."
3492,"""Not the same thing a bit!""
said the Hatter.
""Why, you might just as
well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I
see'!"""
3493,"But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
          It had chosen the very same place:
     Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,
          The disgust that appeared in his face."
3494,"If not, why do things have names at all?”
“I can’t say,” the Gnat replied."
3495,"The lady looked puzzled and thoughtful for a moment: then she almost
clapped her hands."
3496,"She played the air once or twice through, first in quick, and finally in
slow, time; and then gave us the whole song with as much graceful ease
as if she had been familiar with it all her life:--
    ""He stept so lightly to the land,
    All in his manly pride:
    He kissed her cheek, he pressed her hand,
    Yet still she glanced aside."
3497,"Poor Bruno sobbed again.
The complete list of woes was too much for his
feelings."
3498,"--and then all the people cheered again, and one man, who was more
excited than the rest, flung his hat high into the air, and shouted
(as well as I could make out) ""Who roar for the Sub-Warden?"""
3499,"“Term it not ‘radiance,’” said he:
   “’Tis solid nutriment to me."
3500,"""Then where is our authority for Sunday observance?""
""We have, first, the fact that the seventh day was 'sanctified', when
God rested from the work of Creation."
3501,"That must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dream—Dinah!
do you know that you’re
scrubbing a White Queen?"
3502,"Remember what I told you!""
""You telled me I were to say Mister' when I spoked about him, and I were
to say 'Sir' when I spoked to him!"""
3503,"Saying, to
our Creator, 'Thus far and no further.
Thou madest, but thou canst not
rule!'?"""
3504,"My Lady smiled approval of the sentiment, and went on.
""And am I
Vice-Wardeness?"""
3505,"The notion had occurred to her,
   The children would be happier,
         If they were taught to vary."
3506,"And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
a voice outside, and stopped to listen."
3507,"""I'm glad I've seen that done,"" thought Alice.
""I've so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, 'There was some attempt at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,' and I never understood what it meant till now."""
3508,"“Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken!” the Lion replied
angrily, half getting up as he spoke."
3509,"“Only in the usual way,” Alice said, smiling.
“That’s hardly enough,” he said, anxiously."
3510,"Is the
Lecture all ready?""
""Very nearly,"" the Professor humbly replied."
3511,"""The other alternative,"" said the Earl, ""would be a diminuendo series of
repetitions of the same type."
3512,"""But let me go on,"" said the Earl.
""We'll have a third race of men, five
inches high; a fourth race, an inch high--""
""They couldn't eat common beef and mutton, I'm sure!"""
3513,"And
yet you call it a cause of it!""
Arthur pondered a moment."
3514,"""I
only took the regular course.""
""What was that?"""
3515,"“And as for _you_,” she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen,
whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief—but the Queen was
no longer at her side—she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her."
3516,"[Picture: I stood and watched them in the hall] “One day, some
   Spectres chanced to call,
         Dressed in the usual white:
   I stood and watched them in the hall,
   And couldn’t make them out at all,
         They seemed so strange a sight."
3517,"The croaking all ceased in a moment, and I turned to the stage,
in some curiosity to see what Bruno's ideas were as to the behaviour of
Shakespeare's greatest Character."
3518,"“It can never get at me _here_,” she thought: “it’s far too large to
squeeze itself in among the trees."
3519,"Where would be the use of it?” but she did
not say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queen’s feeling."
3520,"By this time the carriages, that were to convey the revelers to their
respective homes, had begun to assemble outside the Castle-grounds: and
it became evident--now that Lady Muriel's cousin had joined our party
that the problem, how to convey five people to Elveston, with a carriage
that would only hold four, must somehow be solved."
3521,"And think you that I should be dumb,
   And full _dolorum omnium_,
   Excepting when _you_ choose to come
         And share my dinner?"
3522,"“I wonder if all the things
move along with us?” thought poor puzzled Alice."
3523,"This, however, did not seem a very likely event, though the
Gardener patiently tried all the small keys, over and over again."
3524,"“Shall he, grown gray among his peers,
   Through the thick curtain of his tears
   Catch glimpses of his earlier years,
                       [Picture: Shall Man be Man?]"
3525,"Sometimes one could trace to their source these random
flashes of thought--as being suggested by the book one was reading,
or struck out from the 'flint' of one's own mind by the 'steel' of
a friend's chance remark but they had also a way of their own, of
occurring, a propos of nothing--specimens of that hopelessly illogical
phenomenon, 'an effect without a cause.'"
3526,"“Do you spell ‘creature’
with a double ‘e’?”
At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his
pockets."
3527,"Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
left-hand bit."
3528,"Remove the joint!”
And the waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its
place."
3529,"""Yes, yes, I see!""
the Warden muttered, glancing carelessly through
them."
3530,"Then she beckoned Sylvie to come and take his hand, and signed to
the children to go back to where the Earl was seated."
3531,"And, by the way, why is it we always begin by asking little
children their names?"
3532,"This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance."
3533,"""Order countermanded by my brother, and supposed to be my doing!
Rather sharp practice!"
3534,"""Shakespeare must have traveled by rail, if only in a dream: 'perturbed
Spirit' is such a happy phrase."""
3535,"The Baron looked slightly offended, and the Vice-Warden discreetly
changed the subject.
""Dinner will soon be ready,"" he said."
3536,"""The Story's finished!
And whatever is to be learned from
it,"" she added, aside to me, ""I'm sure I don't know!"""
3537,"The poor little fellow was quite out of breath, and could only
utter the one word ""Cake!"""
3538,"“Only I never can
remember the rule.
You must be very happy, living in this wood, and
being glad whenever you like!”
“Only it is so _very_ lonely here!” Alice said in a melancholy voice;
and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down
her cheeks."
3539,"""He is a charming boy!""
my Lady exclaimed.
""Even his snores are more
musical than those of other boys!"""
3540,"An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.""
The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, ""From the Queen."
3541,"and ""I never was so happy before,"" though why these two children
who had never been so happy before should both be crying was a mystery
to me."
3542,"from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.
Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying ""Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,"" but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing."
3543,"But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,
          With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--
     Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,
          Which the Bellman declared was all “stuff.”
     “Introduce me, now there’s a good fellow,” he said,
          “If we happen to meet it together!”
      And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,
          Said “That must depend on the weather.”
     The Beaver went simply galumphing about,
          At seeing the Butcher so shy:
     And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,
          Made an effort to wink with one eye."
3544,"“Five times as warm, of course.”
“But they should be five times as _cold_, by the same rule—”
“Just so!” cried the Red Queen."
3545,"""I think I should understand that better,"" Alice said very politely, ""if
I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it."""
3546,"“By the way, Kitty, if only you’d been really with me in my dream,
there was one thing you _would_ have enjoyed—I had such a quantity of
poetry said to me, all about fishes!"
3547,"--and just take his head off outside,"" the Queen added to one of the
officers; but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door."
3548,"I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?” But the King
took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could
neither hear her nor see her."
3549,"And you never saw such universal joy.
The shops are full from morning to
night."
3550,"The moon was shining sulkily,
    Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
    After the day was done—
‘It’s very rude of him,’ she said,
    ‘To come and spoil the fun!’
The sea was wet as wet could be,
    The sands were dry as dry."
3551,"The very first thing she did was to
look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite
pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as
the one she had left behind."
3552,"He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,
          Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,
     Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig
          On the charge of deserting its sty."
3553,"Here, in the foreground, a few clear touches
are not amiss: but a back-ground without mist, you know!"
3554,"Let’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow,
Kitty."
3555,"I'll go snail-hunting
myself some day.""
""I should think oo wouldn't be so silly,"" said Bruno, ""as to go
snail-hunting by oor-self."
3556,"That is, the Present Company.”
   Baffled, she gave a wolfish bark:
   He, aiming blindly in the dark,
   With random shaft had pierced the mark."
3557,"""Have you ever been yourself, Bruno?""
""They invited me once, last week,"" Bruno said, very gravely."
3558,"""Can't remember _what_ things?""
said the Caterpillar.
""Well, I've tried to say '_How doth the little busy bee_,' but it all
came different!"""
3559,"Alice considered a little, and then said ""The fourth.""
""Two days wrong!"""
3560,"Yet this
is in full bloom!
Where did you get these flowers?"""
3561,"“Can _you_ keep from crying by considering things?” she asked.
“That’s the way it’s done,” the Queen said with great decision: “nobody
can do two things at once, you know."
3562,"It'll be no
use their putting their heads down and saying, 'Come up again, dear!'"
3563,"I do hope it will make me grow large again, for
really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"""
3564,"""Oh, I beg your pardon!""
cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
the poor animal's feelings."
3565,"CHAPTER VI
[Sidenote: _Pig and Pepper_]
FOR a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and
wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he
was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have
called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles."
3566,"Please make it out for me, dear Child who reads this!
""But you didn't leave the poor thing so short as that, did you?"""
3567,"""It would
spoil it to say it.""
""I would like to meet the Professor,"" I said."
3568,"It succeeded beautifully.
She had not been walking a minute before she
found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the
hill she had been so long aiming at."
3569,"(For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.)"

         Be bound,” I added, trying
   (Most unsuccessfully) to smile,
   “You’d have been busy all this while,
         Trimming and beautifying?”
   “Why, no,” said he; “perhaps I should
         Have stayed another minute—
   But still no Ghost, that’s any good,
   Without an introduction would
         Have ventured to begin it."
3576,"And that’s the way’ (he gave a wink)

And very gladly will I drink
    Your Honour’s noble health.’
I heard him then, for I had just
    Completed my design
To keep the Menai bridge from rust

3577,"said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her."

welly sorry.

""I don't know what you mean,"" said Alice."
3585,"""A foot hasn't got a head!""
Sylvie put in, but all in vain."
3586,"Sylvie coloured crimson, as she shook off the butter from her frock: but
she kept her lips tight shut, and walked away to the window, where she
stood looking out and trying to recover her temper."
3587,"""I'm sure I'm not Ada,"" she said, ""for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!"
3588,"""But the grandest thing of all was, I fetched the King a glass of
cider!"""
3589,"The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still:
and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the
room to see if she could find any water to throw over him."
3590,"“Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put
to them—and what quantities of honey they must make!"
3591,"Without, the frost, the blinding snow.
The storm-wind’s moody madness—
Within, the firelight’s ruddy glow,
    And childhood’s nest of gladness."
3592,"But
anything, involving a collision of minds only, would be possible in
our ideal world--for of course we must allow mental powers to all,
irrespective of size."
3593,"You
know, in finding the Least Common Multiple, we strike out a quantity

power."
3594,"""Well, you're not doing both, you know.""
""Ah, but I is doing bofe, Miss Praticular!"""
3595,"There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again."
3596,"""Do you observe?""
(such was the phrase with which the wretch began each
sentence) ""Do you observe the way in which that broken arch, at the very
top of the ruin, stands out against the clear sky?"
3597,"""That is true.

Alice thought it would not be civil to say “No,” though it wasn’t at
all what she wanted."
3602,"Never mind, Kitty, we’ll
go and see the bonfire to-morrow.” Here Alice wound two or three turns
of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look:
this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor,
and yards and yards of it got unwound again."
3603,"Sylvie left the room with a sigh.
The Sub-Warden glared angrily at his weeping son."

advantages after all!"

3610,"Of this solution there did not seem

careless tone."

many miles I've fallen by this time?""
she said aloud."
3623,"""And I would like to take
you all with me, to see some friends of mine, that live near here."
3624,"Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day!
Callay!”
    He chortled in his joy."
3625,"“Her style was anything but clear,
   And most unpleasantly severe;
   Her epithets were very queer."
3626,"At last, by a
sudden question, he betrayed the cause of his disquiet."
3627,"""And if you only pinched him?""
""Then it would take ever so much longer, of course."
3628,"Then, as we sat gazing into the fire, and conversation was
lapsing into silence, he made a hurried confession."
3629,"According to this eminent interpreter of the Drama, Hamlet wore a short
black cloak (which he chiefly used for muffling up his face, as if he
suffered a good deal from toothache), and turned out his toes very much
as he walked."
3630,"""A child's first view of life,"" the Earl remarked, with that sweet
sad smile of his, ""is that it is a period to be spent in accumulating
portable property."
3631,"Now, as it happened, there wasn’t such a
thing in the house, that morning.”
“Is there generally?” Alice asked in an astonished tone."
3632,"""It couldn't, you know.""
""Ah, but it did, once!"""
3633,"You can't
mean to say that Fairies are never greedy, or selfish, or cross, or
deceitful, because that would be nonsense, you know."
3634,"*       *       *       *       *
""What a curious feeling!""
""I must be shutting up like a
telescope."""
3635,"So with a yawn I went my way
         To seek the welcome downy,
   And slept, and dreamed till break of day
   Of Poltergeist and Fetch and Fay
         And Leprechaun and Brownie!"
3636,"""You did,"" said the Mock Turtle.
""Hold your tongue!"""
3637,"said the old King, as he took
possession of the Locket.
""Now, Sylvie, look at this."""
3638,"""I don't want to be
divided,"" he said decisively.
""It does very well on a diagram,"" said the Other Professor."
3639,"I must think.
I could go to him, by
myself, well enough."

   “OH, when I was a little Ghost,
         A merry time had we!"
3641,"What's the good of dandelions, now?""
""Dindledums?""
""Oh, they're ever so pretty!"
3642,"“Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty?
How nice and
soft it sounds!"
3643,"The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the
poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw
she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and
just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which
was lying quite still and trying to purr—no doubt feeling that it was
all meant for its good."
3644,"Yet it was evident that all was being done under orders, for I noticed
that all eyes were fixed on the man who stood just under the window, and
to whom the Chancellor was continually whispering."
3645,"Dear boy,"" he went on
aloud, ""his Adiposity would like to see you shoot."
3646,"I'll carry her a little further.
I'm going your way."""
3647,"“It’s hardly safe, though, talking here—
      I’d best get out of reach:
   For such a weight as yours, I fear,
      Must shortly sink the beach!”—
   Insult me thus because I’m stout!"
3648,"""He
isn't, indeed!""
My Lady was appeased.
""Let's go in and receive the Ambassador,"" she
said, and beckoned to the Professor."
3649,"'First accumulate a mass of Facts: and then construct a Theory.'
That,
I believe, is the true Scientific Method."
3650,"""Why,"" said the Gryphon, ""you first form into a line along the
sea-shore----""
""Two lines!"""
3651,"'The Man with the Iron Mask' was, no
doubt, a rarity and a marvel in his own age: in modern London no one
would turn his head to give him a second look!"
3652,"It provides that he shall exercise the full
authority of Warden, and shall have the disposal of the annual revenue
attached to the office, until my return, or, failing that, until Bruno
comes of age: and that he shall then hand over, to myself or to Bruno as
the case may be, the Wardenship, the unspent revenue, and the
contents of the Treasury, which are to be preserved, intact, under his
guardianship."""
3653,"There was, no doubt, a certain amount of absurdity in
applying this title (which, as of course you see without my telling you,
was nothing but 'your Royal Highness' condensed into one syllable) to
a small creature whose father was merely the Warden of Outland: still,
large excuse must be made for a man who had passed several years at the
Court of Fairyland, and had there acquired the almost impossible art of
pronouncing five syllables as one."
3654,"""Bad grammar, Sir!""
his father remarked with some sternness.
""Kindly
attend to that little matter, Professor, as soon as you have corrected
the feverishness."
3655,"Do all that you know, and try all that you don’t:
          Not a chance must be wasted to-day!"
3656,"The Sentinel groaned aloud: a beautiful Greyhound who appeared to be
one of the Ladies in Waiting--fainted away: and all the other Courtiers
hastily drew back, and left plenty of room for the huge Newfoundland to
spring upon the audacious strangers, and tear them limb from limb."
3657,"The moon never does that.""
""Oh, doosn't she though!"""
3658,"The intervals
were perhaps the greatest trial of all, from the efforts I had to make,
to be less than usually sinful, by reading books and sermons as barren
as the Dead Sea."
3659,"The Baron said nothing: he was covered with dust, and seemed much hurt,
both in body and mind."
3660,"I could have taken them for Sylvie
and Bruno less natural that he should show it by such wild dances, such
crazy songs!"
3661,"""We must go to Father!""
Sylvie panted, as they ran down the garden."
3662,"""Come, there's half my plan done
now!
How puzzling all these changes are!"
3663,"“None of your brown bread for me!”
“Certainly—certainly!” the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha."
3664,"The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"""
3665,"""And so they doos!""
he cried, clasping his arms
round her neck."
3666,"Silently the Professor drew front his pocket a square gold watch, with
six or eight hands, and held it out for my inspection."
3667,"But Bruno only folded his arms, and said ""Don't tell me."
3668,"""Would you
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"""
3669,"For, to my surprise, the two walkers were back
again.
""I came back to remind you,"" Arthur said, ""that the trains go every ten
minutes--""
""Nonsense!"""
3670,"It is pleasant and dreamy, no doubt, to float
      With ‘thoughts as boundless, and souls as free’:
   But, suppose you are very unwell in the boat,
      How do you like the Sea?"
3671,"I meant ‘there’s a nice knock-down argument for you!’”
“But ‘glory’ doesn’t mean ‘a nice knock-down argument,’” Alice
objected."
3672,"And he heard the
Lion grunting---""
""Lions don't grunt,"" said Sylvie."
3673,"Autumn frosts have slain July.
Still she haunts me, phantomwise,
Alice moving under skies
Never seen by waking eyes."
3674,"""Well, but that's not so nice as sitting at the table, is it?"""
3675,"And cannot friends be firm and fast,
         And yet bear parting?
And must I then, at Friendship’s call,
   Calmly resign the little all
   (Trifling, I grant, it is and small)
         I have of gladness,
   And lend my being to the thrall
         Of gloom and sadness?"
3676,"“What’s the time now?”
Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said “Half-past four.”
“Let’s fight till six, and then have dinner,” said Tweedledum."
3677,"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking!"
3678,"“I’ll get one,” the Knight said thoughtfully to himself."
3679,"""Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,"" Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
""H'm!"
3680,"her husband testily replied, dragging out the sheet
of brown paper.
""What are you hiding here, my Lady?"
3681,"""Then how far have we come?""
""Just a thousand miles, sweet one, since the Gardener unlocked that door
for you."""
3682,"""Come, there's no use in crying like that!""
said Alice to herself,
rather sharply."
3683,"“It’s dreadfully confusing!”
“That’s the effect of living backwards,” the Queen said kindly: “it
always makes one a little giddy at first—”
“Living backwards!” Alice repeated in great astonishment."
3684,"O those eloquent eyes!
I was drunk with the dawn
               Of a splendid surmise—
   I was stung by a look, I was slain by a tear,
         by a tempest of sighs."
3685,"""The Accessories before the Fact decline to answer any questions,"" I
gravely replied."
3686,"“In a garden, or
in the hedges?”
“Well, it isn’t _picked_ at all,” Alice explained: “it’s _ground_—”
“How many acres of ground?” said the White Queen."
3687,"""Why, did you ever know a conceited man dare to praise a picture?"
3688,"First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (""the exact
shape doesn't matter,"" it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there."
3689,"Before doing this, the Sentinel turned to the children, and said ""Give
me your names."""
3690,"“I’ve been in many gardens
before, but none of the flowers could talk.”
“Put your hand down, and feel the ground,” said the Tiger-lily."
3691,"The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing."
3692,"""What is that donkey doing?""
he said to himself, pausing, aghast, on the
threshold."
3693,"""Follow me!""
were the next words I heard, as the old man waved his hand,
with a dignified grace that ill suited his ragged dress, over a bush,
that stood by the road side, which began instantly to sink into the
earth."
3694,"""Yes, Lovey, a Bear: but not without a
head, I hope!"
3695,"Man's little Day in haste we spend,
     And, from its merry noontide, send
     No glance to meet the silent end."
3696,"Having once decided on his quarters, it needed only
a second or two for him to run up the stem like a tiny squirrel, and
to seat himself astride on the topmost bend, where the fairy-bells
clustered most closely, and from whence he could look down on his
audience from such a height that all shyness vanished, and he began his
Story merrily."
3697,"It's the Frogs' Birthday-Treat--and we've lost the Baby!"""
3698,"""Was oo a shoe-black?""
""Lower than that, your Royal Highness!"
3699,"I’m afraid it would come off!”
“Yes, all his horses and all his men,” Humpty Dumpty went on."
3700,"{Image...'Look eastward!'}
""Fading, with the Night, the memory of a dead love, and the withered
leaves of a blighted hope, and the sickly repinings and moody regrets
that numb the best energies of the soul: and rising, broadening, rolling
upward like a living flood, the manly resolve, and the dauntless will,
and the heavenward gaze of faith--the substance of things hoped for, the
evidence of things not seen!"
3701,"Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?"
3702,"Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen."
3703,"A BEGGAR'S PALACE.
That I had said something, in the act of waking, I felt sure: the hoarse
stifled cry was still ringing in my ears, even if the startled look
of my fellow-traveler had not been evidence enough: but what could I
possibly say by way of apology?"
3704,"There was no ""One, two, three, and
away,"" but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over."
3705,"It's high time you were all in bed!""
On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone."
3706,"the Chancellor replied, modestly, with downcast
eyes.
""Most orators are born, you know."""
3707,"And how odd the directions will look!
Alice's Right Foot, Esq."
3708,"All together rang their voices,
   Angry, loud, discordant voices,
   As of dogs that howl in concert,
   As of cats that wail in chorus."
3709,"She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.
“Ah, you should see ’em come round me of a Saturday night,” Humpty
Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: “for to get
their wages, you know.”
(Alice didn’t venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I
can’t tell _you_.)"
3710,"And then suddenly and swiftly the darkness
of midnight seemed to close in upon us and through the darkness harshly
rang a strange wild song:--
    He thought he saw a Buffalo
    Upon the chimney-piece:
    He looked again, and found it was
    His Sister's Husband's Niece."
3711,"However the party--with the addition of a gentleman, as
good-natured, and as rosy, as the children--seated themselves at it very
contentedly."
3712,"""As short as short!""
""And one day when we was in Outland, oo know--before we came to
Fairyland me and Sylvie took him a big Crocodile."
3713,"“I’m a great hand at inventing things.
Now, I daresay you
noticed, that last time you picked me up, that I was looking rather
thoughtful?”
“You _were_ a little grave,” said Alice."
3714,"With wonder, that increased every moment, I turned over the flowers, and
examined them one by one: there was not a single one among them that
I could remember having ever seen before."
3715,"_What_ are you?""
said the Pigeon.
""I can see you're trying to
invent something!"""
3716,"""Did the rabbit go, after oo wounded it up?""
The Professor clasped his hands on the top of his head, and groaned."
3717,“Can’t you?” the Queen said in a pitying tone.
3718,"“Canst thou desire or pie or puff?
Thy well-bred manners were enough,
   Without such gross material stuff.”
   “Yet well-bred men,” he faintly said,
   “Are not willing to be fed:
   Nor are they well without the bread.”
   Her visage scorched him ere she spoke:
   “There are,” she said, “a kind of folk
   Who have no horror of a joke."
3719,"growled the other.
""Here, put it on,
and look at yourself in the glass."
3720,"“I’m afraid you’ve not had much practice in riding,” she ventured to
say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble."

its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; ""and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an M----""
""Why with an M?"""
3723,"You should look.""
The Beetle murmured something that sounded like ""I did look,"" and Sylvie
went on again."
3724,"""He only came back last night,"" said the Warden, when the kissing was
over: ""he's been traveling post-haste, for the last thousand miles or
so, in order to be here on Sylvie's birthday."
3725,"To
be able to unsay some heedless word--to undo some reckless deed!"
3726,"""Idiot, indeed!""
cried my Lady.
""He's no more an idiot than I am!"""
3727,"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ""Which way?"
3728,"For some
minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ""So you think
you're changed, do you?"""
3729,"[Picture: And this was by the sea]
   There is an insect that people avoid
      (Whence is derived the verb ‘to flee’)."
3730,"Then he undid the chain, and showed her how to fasten it round her
neck, and to hide it away under the edge of her frock."
3731,"my Lady interrupted eagerly, and began comparing the two
Agreements.
""'Item, that he shall exercise the authority of Warden, in the Warden's
absence.'"
3732,"shouted the crowd, so loudly as quite to drown
the orator's thin squeaky voice) ""--that I always sympa--"" he repeated."
3733,"It was, in fact, the Honourable Eric Lindon, who had apparently
fulfilled his task of escorting Lady Muriel home, and was now strolling
leisurely up and down the road outside the house, enjoying; a solitary
cigar."
3734,"“Not yet,” said the Knight.
“But I’ve got a plan for keeping it from
_falling_ off.”
“I should like to hear it, very much.”
“First you take an upright stick,” said the Knight."
3735,"This time it was a White Knight.
He drew up at Alice’s side, and
tumbled off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on
again, and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time
without speaking."
3736,"“That wouldn’t be very nice, I’m afraid—”
“Not very nice _alone_,” he interrupted, quite eagerly: “but you’ve no
idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things—such as
gunpowder and sealing-wax."
3737,"Bruno looked doubtfully at Sylvie.
""I'd rather not, please,"" he said."
3738,"""Only be quick about it!""
And
he began trotting round and round the room, lifting up the chairs, and
shaking them."
3739,"And, as such, Eric Lindon accepted him instantly.
He took the cigar from
his mouth, and delicately shook off the ash, while he considered."
3740,"""He means rook-pie,"" Sylvie explained.
""It were a dead crow,"" Bruno persisted."
3741,"""Oh, thank you, darling!""
""I like your present best of
all!"""
3742,"he added, looking out at us, through the half-opened
door, as we stood waiting in the road.'"
3743,"If you once praise a picture, your character for infallibility
hangs by a thread."
3744,"And now, what deep,
far-reaching Theory was he to construct from them?"
3745,"The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--
          Each working the grindstone in turn:
     But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed
          No interest in the concern:
     Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,
          And vainly proceeded to cite
     A number of cases, in which making laces
          Had been proved an infringement of right."
3746,"She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up
in wool."
3747,"“I never
heard of such a thing!”
“—but there’s one great advantage in it, that one’s memory works both
ways.”
“I’m sure _mine_ only works one way,” Alice remarked."
3748,"What can they
expect more?""
""The Bakery's closed, y'reince!"""
3749,"It could not be
connected with Eric Lindon, I thought, as he had for some days been away
in London: so that, having Lady Muriel almost 'all to himself'--for
I was only too glad to hear those two conversing, to have any wish to
intrude any remarks of my own--he ought, theoretically, to have been
specially radiant and contented with life."
3750,"""It's really
dreadful,"" she muttered to herself, ""the way all the creatures argue."
3751,"""They all shout the same words, I assure you!""
he said: then, leaning well out of the window, he whispered to a man who
was standing close underneath, ""Keep'em together, ca'n't you?"
3752,"It is not like you.
He either fears his fate too much,
    Or his desert is small,
    Who dares not put it to the touch,
    To win or lose it all."""
3753,"“Consider what a great girl you are.
Consider what a long
way you’ve come to-day."
3754,"For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him.
Suddenly she
brightened up."
3755,"A Mastiff, dressed in a scarlet collar, and carrying a musket, was
pacing up and down, like a sentinel, in front of the entrance."
3756,"I'll form a Joint-Stock Company,
    And turn an honest pound or so.'"
3757,"""Don't wait too long!""
I said gaily.
""Faint heart never won fair lady!"""
3758,"""I could
show it you in a minute, only the chalk's a little blunt."""
3759,"""A nice
muddle their slates will be in before the trial's over!"""
3760,"""But what's the difficulty?""
said my Lady.
""Why, don't you see?"
3761,"The Professor laughed a jolly laugh.
""Oh, he's quite tame!"""
3762,"“But the tune _isn’t_ his own invention,” she said to herself: “it’s
‘_I give thee all, I can no more_.’” She stood and listened very
attentively, but no tears came into her eyes."
3763,"""You're nearly the first Fairy I ever saw.
Have you ever seen any people
besides me?"""
3764,"""You have not yet--'
""Yes, I've had some tea, thank you!"""
3765,"It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,
          It had somehow contrived to lose count,
     And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
          By reckoning up the amount."
3766,"Welcoming our Fairy King,
    We ring, ring, ring.
""See, oh, see!"
3767,"The Conspirators returned to their seats, and continued their
conversation in an undertone, so as not to be heard by Uggug, who was
still standing at the window."
3768,"However, he was back again
in a few moments, having tucked under his chin the end of a tuft of
wool (probably left on the thorn by a wandering sheep), which made a
magnificent beard, that reached nearly down to his feet."
3769,"“It is the voice of my child!” the White Queen cried out as she rushed
past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the
cinders."
3770,"She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves."
3771,"""But what is the new Money-Act?""
The Professor brightened up again."
3772,"You were telling me,"" he continued, as the
trio left the house, ""something about a great battle in which you had
the command of the infantry--""
""True,"" said the Baron."
3773,"So she took it, and ate it as well as she could:
and it was _very_ dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly
choked in all her life."
3774,"""I haven't got any title.""
The Fairy seemed to think that in that case I really wasn't worth the
trouble of talking to, for he quietly went on digging, and tearing the
flowers to pieces."
3775,"She had indeed abundant cause for hating
Sunday!""
""Here is the letter,"" said Lady Muriel, returning."
3776,"“You ought to return thanks in a neat speech,” the Red Queen said,
frowning at Alice as she spoke."
3777,"And so, in friendly chat, we took our homeward ways, and wished each
other 'good-night' at the door of his hotel."
3778,"It is a most unusual proceeding, your Majesty!
the Head-Growler
exclaimed, almost choking with vexation at being set aside, for he
had put on his best Court-suit, made entirely of cat-skins, for the
occasion."
3779,"As the years went on, I jotted down,
at odd moments, all sorts of odd ideas, and fragments of dialogue, that
occurred to me--who knows how?--with a transitory suddenness that left
me no choice but either to record them then and there, or to abandon
them to oblivion."
3780,"“It’s my own invention—to keep clothes and sandwiches in.
You see
I carry it upside-down, so that the rain can’t get in.”
“But the things can get _out_,” Alice gently remarked."
3781,"""If oo cuts it off, will oo give it to me, please?"
3782,"The Emperor was so kind as to wish that I should have the
credit of it."
3783,"""Hooyah wah!""
said a deep voice inside.
(That's Doggee for ""Come in!"")"
3784,"He says they're
too waggly!""
Words fail me to describe the beauty of the little group--couched on a
patch of moss, on the trunk of the fallen tree, that met my eager gaze:
Sylvie reclining with her elbow buried in the moss, and her rosy cheek
resting in the palm of her hand, and Bruno stretched at her feet with
his head in her lap."
3785,"""What do you mean by that?""
said the Caterpillar sternly.
""Explain
yourself!"""
3786,"""I ca'n't,"" said the Professor.
""Excuse me a moment."
3787,"When he cried “Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!”
           What on earth was the helmsman to do?"
3788,"""I'll tell you what I'll do,"" Bruno said in a half-whisper, as we
worked."
3789,"""I've read that in some book,
but I don't remember where."""
3790,"Soon one of the plates, furnished with a complete slice of mutton and
two potatoes, was handed up to the presiding gentleman, who quietly
replaced the slice on the joint, and the potatoes in the dish."
3791,"""Yes,"" said Arthur, apparently in answer to my thoughts, ""those 'high'
services are fast becoming pure Formalism."
3792,"The wall between the pillars was entirely
covered, to the height of six or seven feet, with creepers, from which
hung quantities of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers, that almost hid
the leaves."
3793,"""Bofe,"" said Bruno.
""And the Man took the Goat out of the Sack."""
3794,"""I think not,"" Sylvie whispered in reply.
""He generally turns
head-over-heels when he doesn't know any more words."""
3795,"But she waited patiently.
""Once,"" said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, ""I was a real
Turtle."""
3796,"""But what happens when you come to the beginning again?""
Alice ventured
to ask."
3797,"""Well, we wroted a Nursery-Song, and the Professor mangled it longer for
us."
3798,"We overtook the
other couple just as they reached the Station, and both Lady Muriel and
Eric greeted the children as old friends--the latter with the words ""So
you got to Babylon by candlelight, after all?"""
3799,"'Unless you leave this house,' he said,
    'I'll send for the Police!'"
3800,"He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!""
cried Alice in a
sorrowful tone, ""I'm afraid I've offended it again!"""
3801,"Halve my height, and you produce the
same effect.""
""Happy, happy, happy Small!"""
3802,"""Shortened it up?""
""That's something new.
How does he do it?"""
3803,"""But don't you always want
to be happy, Bruno?""
""Not always,"" Bruno said thoughtfully."
3804,"It had never struck me in that light before.""
""In what light?"""
3805,"That’s what _I_ say!”
“Would you tell me, please,” said Alice “what that means?”
“Now you talk like a reasonable child,” said Humpty Dumpty, looking
very much pleased."
3806,"Bruno cried triumphantly.
""Oo weren't
looking--but I watched it.
And it walked on tippiety-toe, so as it
wouldn't wake itself, 'cause it thought it were asleep."
3807,"the Gardener promptly replied.
""I always please.
Never
displeases nobody.
There you are!"""
3808,"“I’ve often spent ten pounds on stuff,
         In dressing as a Double;
   But, though it answers as a puff,
   It never has effect enough
         To make it worth the trouble."
3809,"This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
and it stood for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of
him), while the rest waited in silence."
3810,"“It’s a Snark!” was the sound that first came to their ears,
          And seemed almost too good to be true."
3811,"She felt very curious to know what it
was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen."
3812,"""Go on then,"" said the Professor.
""What must be must be."""
3813,"Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very
little while—and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like
snow, as they lay in heaps at her feet—but Alice hardly noticed this,
there were so many other curious things to think about."
3814,"He then signed it himself, and my Lady
and the Chancellor added their names as witnesses."
3815,"The only phenomenon, that gave
me any uneasiness, was the rapid increase in the size of the little
creature we were following, which became every moment more and more like
a real lion."
3816,"She said
this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
age knew the meaning of it at all."
3817,"Nor in this was he mistaken,
   As the picture failed completely.
So in turn the other sisters."
3818,"""Put oor ear welly low down,"" said Bruno, ""and I'll tell oo a secret!"
3819,"came from all sides, and Lady Muriel--not
being one of those lady-singers who think it de rigueur to decline
to sing till they have been petitioned three or four times, and have
pleaded failure of memory, loss of voice, and other conclusive reasons
for silence--began at once:--
{Image...'Three badgers on a mossy stone'}
     ""There be three Badgers on a mossy stone,
     Beside a dark and covered way:
     Each dreams himself a monarch on his throne,
     And so they stay and stay
     Though their old Father languishes alone,
     They stay, and stay, and stay."
3820,"--you advance twice----""
""Each with a lobster as a partner!"""
3821,"""Certainly we may!""
I replied, delighted with the illustration.
""And
what a grand thing it would be,"" I went on dreamily, thinking aloud
rather than talking, ""if we could only apply that Rule to books!"
3822,"It's so interesting!""
The Vice-Warden and the Chancellor interchanged a wink or two."
3823,"“Perhaps,” he added, “to _your_ ear
         That sounds an easy thing?"
3824,"“It says ‘Bough-wough!’” cried a Daisy: “that’s why its branches are
called boughs!”
“Didn’t you know _that_?” cried another Daisy, and here they all began
shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices."
3825,"""I thought I saw--"" I murmured sleepily: and then the phrase insisted
on conjugating itself, and ran into ""you thought you saw--he thought he
saw--"" and then it suddenly went off into a song:--
    ""He thought he saw an Elephant,
    That practised on a fife:
    He looked again, and found it was
    A letter from his wife."
3826,"The happy voices cry.
Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
            Thus slowly, one by one,
          Its quaint events were hammered out--
            And now the tale is done,
          And home we steer, a merry crew,
            Beneath the setting sun."
3827,"By the time my Lady had returned, from explaining things to the
music-master, the map had been hung up, and the Baron was already much
bewildered by the Vice-Warden's habit of pointing to one place while he
shouted out the name of another."
3828,"Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?"
3829,"Lady Muriel murmured rapturously.
""None but
the Short, none but the Short, none but the Short enjoy the Tall!"""
3830,"""Fifteen houses!
Is it possible?""
my Lady replied.
""I thought it was
fourteen!"""
3831,"""Brother!""
""--and seven makes a hundred and ninety-four, which is sixteen and
two-pence,"" the Sub-Warden replied."
3832,"Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, ""I think
you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first."""
3833,"This was a puzzler.
After a pause, Alice began, “Well!"
3834,"“I was coming to that,” the Knight said.
“The song really _is_
‘_A-sitting On A Gate_’: and the tune’s my own invention.”
So saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck:
then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile
lighting up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his
song, he began."
3835,"The very first trial of the large key proved a success: the Gardener
opened the door, and held out his hand for the money."
3836,"They cry “He is so sleek and slim,
   It’s quite a treat to look at him!”
   They vanish in tobacco smoke,
      Those visionary maids—
   I feel a sharp and sudden poke
      Between the shoulder-blades—
   “Why, Brown, my boy!"
3837,"How great was Peter's joy to find
    His friend in such a genial vein!"
3838,"""It has occurred to me,"" said Arthur, ""as a curious problem in
Teleology--the Science of Final Causes,"" he added, in answer to an
enquiring look from Lady Muriel."
3839,"Lady Muriel and her father gave me a delightfully warm welcome.
They
were not of the folk we meet in fashionable drawing-rooms who conceal
all such feelings as they may chance to possess beneath the impenetrable
mask of a conventional placidity."
3840,"The Chancellor bit his lip, and was silent.
He evidently feared that,
stupid as she looked, she understood what she said this time, and was
having a joke at his expense."
3841,"How very
odd to find trees growing here!
And actually here’s a little brook!"
3842,"He
had a thorn in his hand, which he held out at arm's length, as if he
were a little afraid of it."
3843,"And, so intent were they on this interesting question, that
neither of them even looked up till the Professor, leading Uggug by the
hand, stood close before them."
3844,"Bruno solemnly replied.
""Then it wasn't solid, like Sylvie and you?"""
3845,"“You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought!”
“Does that kind go smoothly?” the Knight asked in a tone of great
interest, clasping his arms round the horse’s neck as he spoke, just in
time to save himself from tumbling off again."
3846,"""You're right, my dear,"" the Vice-Warden soothingly I replied."
3847,"I did not state this on the title-page, since
it seemed only due, to the artist of all these (to my mind) wonderful
pictures, that his name should stand there alone."
3848,"""Look at the literature of Hymns, now.
How cankered it is, through and
through, with selfishness!"
3849,"“Why, because there’s nobody with me!” cried Humpty Dumpty."
3850,"And so the work went on, steadily undoing itself,
and the neatly-stitched little dresses, or whatever they were, steadily
falling to pieces."
3851,"So she tucked it under her arm, that it might not escape
again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend."
3852,"“It’s out of temper, I think.
I’ve pinned it here,
and I’ve pinned it there, but there’s no pleasing it!”
“It _can’t_ go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side,”
Alice said, as she gently put it right for her; “and, dear me, what a
state your hair is in!”
“The brush has got entangled in it!” the Queen said with a sigh."
3853,"Now if you’d asked _my_ advice, I’d have
said ‘Leave off at seven’—but it’s too late now.”
“I never ask advice about growing,” Alice said indignantly."
3854,"In Vishnu-land what Avatar?""
""Aye, look Eastward!""
Arthur eagerly replied, pausing at the stair-case
window, which commanded a fine view of the sea and the eastward horizon."
3855,"My Lady was the first to notice their approach.
""Why, here's the
Professor!"""
3856,"“If it once becomes dark, there’s no chance of a Snark--
          We have hardly a minute to waste!”
     “I skip forty years,” said the Baker, in tears,
          “And proceed without further remark
     To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
          To help you in hunting the Snark."
3857,"Then I thought “Lucky boy!
’Tis for _you_ that she whimpers!”
            And I noted with joy
               Those sensational simpers:
   And I said “This is scrumptious!”—a
         phrase I had learned from the Devonshire shrimpers."
3858,"the Professor asked, beaming on them with a
very different look from what Uggug ever got from him."
3859,"The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave ""Turn them
over!"""
3860,"""Do you mean that
they are engaged?""
""They have been engaged--in a sense--for two years,"" the old man gently
replied: ""that is, he has had my promise to consent to it, so soon as
he could secure a permanent and settled line in life."
3861,"""I must take you all through the
Ivory Door again.
You've stayed your full time."""
3862,"“Next Boy!” said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite
certain he would only shout out “Contrariwise!” and so he did."
3863,"""Macbeth!""
she added, as Bruno re-appeared.
Macbeth had something twisted round him, that went over one shoulder and
under the other arm, and was meant, I believe, for a Scotch plaid."
3864,"“Well, I don’t want any _to-day_, at any rate.”
“You couldn’t have it if you _did_ want it,” the Queen said."
3865,"""It might come just when you wanted
to be happy!""
That would be awkward, I admitted, taking it quite as a matter of course
that he had so suddenly caught sight of me."
3866,"And there he is on the floor again!""
""A little bruised, perhaps?"""
3867,"(I make no doubt he is right in saying the heart is affected:
    all your symptoms point that way.)"
3868,"""That's the judge,"" she said to
herself, ""because of his great wig."""
3869,"""And he's so clever!""
my Lady continued.
""No one will enjoy your Lecture
more by the way, have you fixed the time for it yet?"
3870,"She soon got
it out again, and put it right; ""not that it signifies much,"" she said
to herself; ""I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial
one way up as the other."""
3871,"But the wheezy old Station-Master happened to be close behind me: he
wasn't good for much, poor old man, but he was good for this; and,
before I could turn round, he had the child clasped in his arms, saved
from the certain death she was rushing to."
3872,"Down, down, down.
There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again."
3873,"Now there was a Ghost last month--I
don't mean a real Ghost in in Supernature--but in a Magazine."
3874,"“We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,
          (Four weeks to the month you may mark),
     But never as yet (’tis your Captain who speaks)
          Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!"
3875,"“I should win easy,” said the Lion.
“I’m not so sure of that,” said the Unicorn."
3876,"A sudden gloom overcast the Professor's jolly face.
""They did it as I
went home after the Election,"" he mournfully replied."
3877,"For then
     You will softly and suddenly vanish away,
          And never be met with again!’
     “It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,
          When I think of my uncle’s last words:
     And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
          Brimming over with quivering curds!"
3878,"“My mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new
things.”
“Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did,” he went on after
a pause, “was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course.”
“In time to have it cooked for the next course?” said Alice."
3879,"""Will the Story have a Moral to it?""
I asked Sylvie, while Bruno was
away behind the hedge, dressing for the first 'Bit.'"
3880,"Sylvie gently explained matters.
""I'm afraid we ca'n't manage it,""
she said in a low voice."
3881,"Come on!""
""Everybody says 'come on!'
here,"" thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: ""I never was so ordered about in my life, never!"""
3882,"It was all very well to say ""Drink me,"" but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry."
3883,"""Once there were a Mouse and a Crocodile and a Man and a Goat and a
Lion."""
3884,"Only they wouldn’t answer at all, if they were wise.”
She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked
very cool and shady."
3885,"are still ringing in your ears, ""--but she wouldn't do it, you know."
3886,"“Seven years and six months!” Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully.
“An
uncomfortable sort of age."
3887,"'At length I realise,' he said,
    ""The bitterness of Life!'"""
3888,"exclaimed the Professor.
""I know I did,"" Bruno replied very humbly."
3889,"""You grant then that I can, by an act of free choice, move
this cup,"" suiting the action to the word, ""this way or that way?"""
3890,"""Begin at the beginning,"" the King said gravely, ""and go on till you
come to the end; then stop."""
3891,"All this time Dog-waiters, in splendid livery, were running up with
lighted candles: but, as fast as they put them upon the table, other
waiters ran away with them, so that there never seemed to be one for
me, though the Master kept nudging me with his elbow, and repeating, ""I
ca'n't let you sleep here!"
3892,"And God knows whether you'll ever see me again, or hear
of me!"""
3893,"Bruno whispered to Sylvie.
""The difference between 'convenient' and 'inconvenient' is best
explained by an example,"" said the Other Professor, who had overheard
the question."
3894,"“You make me laugh so that
I can hardly hold you!
And don’t keep your mouth so wide open!"
3895,"""Hamlet!""
was suddenly proclaimed, in the clear sweet tones I knew so
well."
3896,"The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse."
3897,"""This is no jesting matter!""
""I will consult my brother,"" said the Warden."
3898,"“And
some eggs are very pretty, you know” she added, hoping to turn her
remark into a sort of a compliment."
3899,"We visit for a single day,
   And whether then we go, or stay,
         Depends on circumstances."
3900,"“You needn’t go on making remarks like that,” Humpty Dumpty said:
“they’re not sensible, and they put me out.”
“I sent a message to the fish:
I told them ‘This is what I wish.’
The little fishes of the sea,
They sent an answer back to me."
3901,"The Queen smiled and passed on.
""Who _are_ you talking to?"""
3902,"If only the
flowers had been eatables, one might have suspected a thief of quite
another shape--""
""You mean that universal explanation for all mysterious disappearances,
'the cat did it'?"""
3903,"“My father was a Brownie, Sir;
         My mother was a Fairy."
3904,"""It's called a Phlizz.""
""And how do you make a Phlizz, Bruno?"""
3905,"“Don’t talk!” he cried, as I began
         To mutter some excuse."
3906,"Guileless peasant!""
he proceeded in a
louder voice.
""Would you tell us the way to Outland?"""
3907,"""Very much indeed,"" said Alice.
""Come, let's try the first figure!"""
3908,"He got behind Alice as he spoke.
""A cat may look at a king,"" said Alice."
3909,"Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
          And they knew that some danger was near:
     The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
          And even the Butcher felt queer."
3910,"“Then I like the Carpenter
best—if he didn’t eat so many as the Walrus.”
“But he ate as many as he could get,” said Tweedledum."
3911,"After a minute's
search, I found him sitting at the edge of the ditch, by the side of the
little Frog, and looking rather disconsolate."
3912,"Do you know her?""
""Yes--I do know her."""
3913,"Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of
hurting the other one’s feelings; so, as the best way out of the
difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they
were dancing round in a ring."
3914,"It's part of the--""
""Oh, don't talk of Conspiracies!"""
3915,"I expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with this explanation.
""But
aren't you going to pick me any dindledums, after all?"""
3916,"I felt very happy too, but of course I didn't cry: ""big things"" never
do, you know we leave all that to the Fairies."
3917,"the Professor answered with a proud smile.
""After about
a minute, he quietly turns a tap at the lower end of the P."
3918,"THE MAGIC LOCKET.
THE BARONS EMBASSY.
A RIDE ON A LION.
A JESTER AND A BEAR."
3919,"As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name ""W. RABBIT"" engraved upon it."
3920,"""Of course that'll do it!""
And he shut up the book so quickly that he caught the Other Professor's
nose between the leaves, and gave it a severe pinch."
3921,"The Theory hardly rose to the dignity of a Working
Hypothesis.
Clearly more Facts were needed."
3922,"""Yes, of course,"" replied the Keeper, laying hold of the chain, that
hung from the Bear's collar, with one hand, while with the other he
cracked a little whip."
3923,"It is written, not for money, and not for fame,
but in the hope of supplying, for the children whom I love, some
thoughts that may suit those hours of innocent merriment which are the
very life of Childhood; and also in the hope of suggesting, to them and
to others, some thoughts that may prove, I would fain hope, not wholly
out of harmony with the graver cadences of Life."
3924,"King Lear folded his arms (to the imminent peril of his beard) and said,
in a mild explanatory tone, ""Ay, every inch a king!"""
3925,"Let's put 'em in rows--all the
red together, and all the blue together."""
3926,"Go, throng each other’s drawing-rooms,
      Ye idols of a petty clique:
   Strut your brief hour in borrowed plumes,
      And make your penny-trumpets squeak."
3927,"[Picture: The doggie ceased his noise]
   Syne, he has taen a mutton-bane—
      The doggie ceased his noise,
   And followed doon the kitchen stair
      That prince of button-boys!"
3928,"They'll not treat her bad, yer may
depend.
They're varry canny fowk."
3929,"There was certainly too much of it in the air.
Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and the baby was sneezing and howling alternately without
a moment's pause."
3930,"""Uggug, indeed!""
I exclaimed, in a burst of indignation I could no
longer control."
3931,"“The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,
          Which is constantly carries about,
     And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--
          A sentiment open to doubt."
3932,"""Let's follow it,"" said Sylvie: and this also turned out a happy
thought."
3933,"Won't you sing us
something, Lady Muriel?
I know you do sing without music."""
3934,"Near the end of the passage the Professor stopped.
""This is his room,""
he said, pointing to the solid wall."
3935,"“And as to being in a fright,
         Allow me to remark
   That Ghosts have just as good a right
   In every way, to fear the light,
         As Men to fear the dark.”
   “No plea,” said I, “can well excuse
         Such cowardice in you:
   For Ghosts can visit when they choose,
   Whereas we Humans ca’n’t refuse
         To grant the interview.”
   He said “A flutter of alarm
         Is not unnatural, is it?"
3936,"Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the
worsted while I wasn’t looking!"
3937,"It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again."
3938,"“What does it mean?”
“_Must_ a name mean something?” Alice asked doubtfully."
3939,"And it could never overtake the
failing floor!""
""I see it clearly,"" said Lady Muriel."
3940,"The music grew fuller and richer at every moment: other manly voices
joined in the refrain: and soon I heard the heavy thud that told me the
boat had touched the beach, and the harsh grating of the shingle as the
men dragged it up."
3941,"“What makes you say that?” he asked, as he scrambled back into
the saddle, keeping hold of Alice’s hair with one hand, to save himself
from falling over on the other side."
3942,"""Have you guessed the riddle yet?""
the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again."
3943,"“Yes, but then I _had_ done the things I was punished for,” said Alice:
“that makes all the difference.”
“But if you _hadn’t_ done them,” the Queen said, “that would have been
better still; better, and better, and better!” Her voice went higher
with each “better,” till it got quite to a squeak at last."
3944,"I
followed him to the window, and we stood together, looking out, in
silence."
3945,"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_!"
3946,"""It were more like a
duck.""
""Single notes are apt to have that effect,"" the Other Professor said
with a sigh."
3947,"Yet I
does my duty!
I gets up wriggle-early at five--""
""If I was oo,"" said Bruno, ""I wouldn't wriggle so early."
3948,"""You're sure you don't mind?""
said the Earl.
""I'm afraid the carriage
wont take us all, and I don't like to suggest to Eric to desert his
cousin so soon."""
3949,"""I saw there was just time,"" Eric said lightly.
""A soldier must learn to carry his life in his hand, you know."
3950,"""Thought there might be.
Met a lunatic just now.
Queer old fish as ever
I saw!"""
3951,"A footman, in a handsome livery, came forwards and respectfully touched
his hat."
3952,"Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old
Frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards
her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on."
3953,"""Oh, he's fallen down on
the rails!""
she cried, and darted past me at a speed that quite defied
the hasty effort I made to stop her."
3954,"the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
""You did!""
said the Hatter."

see."
3964,"“You take some flour—”
“Where do you pick the flower?” the White Queen asked."
3965,"""Listen,
children!
Now you'll hear something worth knowing!""
""Horizontal weather,"" said the Professor, and made straight for the
door, very nearly trampling on Bruno, who had only just time to get out
of his way."
3966,"Some fancied they heard in the air
          A weary and wandering sigh
     Then sounded like “-jum!” but the others declare
          It was only a breeze that went by."
3967,"said the Duck.
""Found _it_,"" the Mouse replied rather crossly: ""of course you know what
'it' means."""
3968,"I did not like to press any further advice on my friend, whose judgment,
I felt, was so much more sober and thoughtful than my own; and we parted
without more words on the subject that had now absorbed his thoughts,
nay, his very life."
3969,"We 'waited' on ourselves, as the modern barbarism (combining two good
things in such a way as to secure the discomforts of both and the
advantages of neither) of having a picnic with servants to wait upon
you, had not yet reached this out-of-the-way region--and of course the
gentlemen did not even take their places until the ladies had been duly
provided with all imaginable creature-comforts."
3970,"And when at last she drew
a long breath, and gave her verdict--in a hurried whisper, and without
the slightest regard to grammar--""It's the loveliest thing as I never
saw in all my life before!"""
3971,"Oh, dear!
I'd nearly forgotten that
I've got to grow up again!"
3972,"said Sylvie, trying to frown, a thing she never
managed particularly well."
3973,"""At that time,"" he went on, ""a great tidal wave of selfishness
was sweeping over human thought."
3974,"“Do you know the
lid’s open?”
“I didn’t know it,” the Knight said, a shade of vexation passing over
his face."
3975,"Do let’s pretend that
I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.”
But this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten."
3976,"However, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of
his voice “They’re at it again!”
“Do you call _that_ a whisper?” cried the poor King, jumping up and
shaking himself."
3977,"There was no label this time
with the words ""DRINK ME,"" but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
to her lips."
3978,"If I or she should chance to be
             Involved in this affair,
           He trusts to you to set them free,
             Exactly as we were."
3979,"I couldn't help smiling at this.
""You know I sometimes wash my face,
Bruno."
3980,"Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,
    Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well
Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask
    The tale he loves to tell."
3981,"“With this you make a kind of slide
         (It answers best with suet),
   On which you must contrive to glide,
   And swing yourself from side to side—
         One soon learns how to do it."
3982,"But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!
’Tis your glorious duty to seek it!"
3983,"He never does!""
""Did he ever begin a Poem and not leave off again?"""
3984,"She appealed to me.
""Crocodiles do run, don't they?"""
3985,"""Whoever
lives there,"" thought Alice, ""it'll never do to come upon them _this_
size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!"""
3986,"First, a Child's Bible.
The only real essentials of this would be,
carefully selected passages, suitable for a child's reading and
pictures."
3987,"With glance that ever sought the ground,
   She moved her lips without a sound,
   And every now and then she frowned."
3988,"Rude spirits of the seething outer strife,
    Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright,
Deem, if you list, such hours a waste of life,
    Empty of all delight!"
3989,"It trembled
as I clasped it.
I tried to frame some words of sympathy; but they seemed poor and cold,
and I left them unspoken."
3990,"“She’s one of the
thorny kind.”
“Where does she wear the thorns?” Alice asked with some curiosity."
3991,"""I was just
watching two Frogs that were having a race.""
""Which won it?"""
3992,"When he had satisfied himself that the flowers were in tune, he seated
himself on the dead mouse (he never seemed really comfortable anywhere
else), and, looking up at me with a merry twinkle in his eyes, he began."
3993,"""Don't grunt,""
said Alice; ""that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself."""
3994,"""But look here, Professor dear!""
""He needn't open the
door for us, at all."
3995,"Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!”
“I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall!”
thought Alice."
3996,"“And you were all the better for it, I know!” the Queen said
triumphantly."
3997,"You don't understand
these things.""
""I can walk as well as you can,"" I repeated."
3998,"Is not he bound to thee, as thou to him,
      By vows, unwhispered here, yet heard above?"
3999,"It's a--what's that hard word, Sylvie?""
""It was a Phlizz,"" Sylvie gravely replied."
4000,"“There was too much dust to see anything.
What a time the Monster is,
cutting up that cake!”
Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great
dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife."
4001,"Then of course the house goes faster than its natural rate of
falling: but the furniture--with our noble selves--would go on failing
at their old pace, and would therefore be left behind."""
4002,"said the Professor.
Bruno sat up and dried his eyes.
""Isn't he kind, Mister Sir?"""
4003,"he exclaimed, in sudden excitement.
""And you never told us how you got them!"""
4004,"""Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
cat in the world!"
4005,"""Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,"" said the Dormouse; ""not in
that ridiculous fashion."""
4006,"And yet it was a very clever pudding to invent.”
“What did you mean it to be made of?” Alice asked, hoping to cheer him
up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it."
4007,"""Well, never mind, my little man!""
""Shall I help you with that
job?"""
4008,"""Remember that!""
Sylvie whispered to Bruno, ""It's a very good rule for
whenever you hurt yourself."""
4009,"This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from
one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter."
4010,"""Has the Other Professor come too?""
Bruno asked in an awe-struck voice."
4011,"So they got thrown out to sea.
So they had to
fall a long way."
4012,"“A little—a little,” the King replied, rather nervously.
“You shouldn’t
have run him through with your horn, you know.”
“It didn’t hurt him,” the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going on,
when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather
instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the
deepest disgust."
4013,"""I would say of them, as of all kinds of work, whatever is innocent on a
week-day, is innocent on Sunday, provided it does not interfere with the
duties of the day."""
4014,"I saw an aged aged man,
    A-sitting on a gate.
‘Who are you, aged man?’ I said,
    ‘and how is it you live?’
And his answer trickled through my head
    Like water through a sieve."
4015,"""It goes, of course, at the usual rate.
Only the time has to go with it."
4016,"""Practically, we should rise to the ceiling,"" said the Earl."
4017,"The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used
to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished,
and it more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it,
that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged
to."
4018,"""You see, my precious one, that there are fifteen houses in
Green Street, before you turn into West Street."""
4019,"And
the old man smiled, half-contemptuously.
The Lord Chancellor recovered himself with a great effort, and pointed
to the open window."
4020,"She went on and on, a long way,
but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
pointing the same way, one marked “TO TWEEDLEDUM’S HOUSE” and the other
“TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.”
“I do believe,” said Alice at last, “that they live in the same house!"
4021,"""And that weren't good tea!""
""It were so welly weak!"""
4022,"“There he goes!
Right on his head
as usual!
However, he gets on again pretty easily—that comes of having
so many things hung round the horse—” So she went on talking to
herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and
the Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other."
4023,"I think you will find that to be the teaching of the
Bible, as a whole, beginning with 'that thy days may be long in the
land,' and ending with 'be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect.'"""
4024,"""Yes, it's quite dead,"" I said, after stooping to examine it."
4025,"“When I fasten my shawl again,” the poor Queen groaned out: “the brooch
will come undone directly."
4026,"“Silence, every one of you!” cried the Tiger-lily, waving
itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement."
4027,"""It would break my heart to know it!""
""Yet is it wise to leave it unasked?"
4028,"Stop this
moment, I tell you!""
But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall."
4029,"“Are you animal—vegetable—or
mineral?” he said, yawning at every other word."
4030,"And Sylvie rewarded the old man with a
hearty kiss.
""And the pins they gave me for nothing!"""
4031,"“To be sure I do.” said Alice.
“So do I,” the White Queen whispered: “we’ll often say it over
together, dear."
4032,"“You’ve been listening at doors—and behind trees—and
down chimneys—or you couldn’t have known it!”
“I haven’t, indeed!” Alice said very gently."
4033,"“It’s excessively awkward to mention it now--
          As I think I’ve already remarked.”
      And the man they called “Hi!” replied, with a sigh,
          “I informed you the day we embarked."
4034,"""We've only got to make
people think he's dead!
We haven't got to kill him!"
4035,"""My son was in the act of saying 'sixty-three' as you fell!"""
4036,"And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through that little door into that lovely garden."
4037,"""You are old,"" said the youth, ""and your jaws are too weak
            For anything tougher than suet;
          Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
            Pray, how did you manage to do it?"""
4038,"How much is it, this year, my
man?""
The tailor had come in while he was speaking."
4039,"THE BARONS EMBASSY.
I was following the Vice-Warden, but, on second thoughts, went after my
Lady, being curious to see how she would manage to keep the children out
of sight."
4040,"""I beg your pardon,"" said Alice very humbly: ""you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?"""
4041,"said the Professor, gently clapping his hands.
""It's going
sideways--if I may so express myself."""
4042,"And we made our
adieux, and escaped, while the Earl was still absorbed in examining the
mysterious bouquet."
4043,"I accept it as my doing.""
""And they do say,"" the Chancellor went on sheepishly--looking much
more like a convicted thief than an Officer of State, ""that a change
of Government, by the abolition of the Sub-Warden---I mean,"" he hastily
added, on seeing the Warden's look of astonishment, ""the abolition of
the office of Sub-Warden, and giving the present holder the right to
act as Vice-Warden whenever the Warden is absent--would appease all this
seedling discontent I mean,"" he added, glancing at a paper he held in
his hand, ""all this seething discontent!"""
4044,"""Are you coming with us to church?""
""Thanks, no,"" he courteously replied."
4045,"The children got down off his knees, each secured a
hand, and the happy trio set off for the Library--followed by me."
4046,"""You have studied Physiology, then?""
a certain young Doctor courteously
enquired."
4047,"""Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?""
""Yes, that's it,"" said the Hatter with a sigh: ""it's always tea-time,
and we've no time to wash the things between whiles."""
4048,"The look of displeasure, which had begun to come over Arthur's face
when the young Captain spoke of Love so lightly, faded away as the song
proceeded, and he listened with evident delight."
4049,"Of course
we'll have the coach-and-four out, at once.
And I'll take the title of
Emperor, as soon as we can safely hold an Election."
4050,"Sylvie gave another little gasp: this rapid dodging about among the
characters of the Story had taken away her breath."
4051,"“I hope it encouraged him,” she said, as she turned to run down the
hill: “and now for the last brook, and to be a Queen!"
4052,"""Would you have the kindness to
mention,"" he said, addressing me with his usual old-fashioned courtesy,
""whereabouts we are just now and who we are, beginning with me?"""
4053,"The ordinary course of events first, to think nothing about me; then,
hearing my footsteps to look up and see me; and then to wonder what
business I had there--would be reversed by the action of my Watch."
4054,"My Lady laughed merrily.
""Some books would be reduced to blank paper,
I'm afraid!"""
4055,"Fit the Sixth
                  THE BARRISTER’S DREAM
     They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
          They pursued it with forks and hope;
     They threatened its life with a railway-share;
          They charmed it with smiles and soap."
4056,"[Picture: His face grew stern and sad]
SIZE AND TEARS
                 [Picture: When on the sandy shore I sit]
   WHEN on the sandy shore I sit,
      Beside the salt sea-wave,
   And fall into a weeping fit
      Because I dare not shave—
   A little whisper at my ear
   Enquires the reason of my fear."
4057,"You could not see a cloud, because
    No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying over head—
    There were no birds to fly."
4058,"Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and, the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a little
way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the
while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its
tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut."
4059,"It does very well
for reciting; but for lecturing--""
""You are quite right,"" said my Lady."
4060,"And in another minute the
disguises were stowed away in the cupboard, the door unbolted, and the
two Conspirators seated lovingly side-by-side on the sofa, earnestly
discussing a book the Vice-Warden had hastily snatched off the table,
which proved to be the City-Directory of the capital of Outland."
4061,"“You’re like a man I used to meet,
         Who got one day so furious
   In arguing, the simple heat
   Scorched both his slippers off his feet!”
         I said “_That’s very curious_!”
            [Picture: Scorched both his slippers off his feet]
   “Well, it _is_ curious, I agree,
         And sounds perhaps like fibs:
   But still it’s true as true can be—
   As sure as your name’s Tibbs,” said he."
4062,"The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking
something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top."
4063,"""If I eat one of these cakes,"" she thought, ""it's sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and, as it can't possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose."""
4064,"Five dressy girls, of Thirty-one or more:
   So gracious to the shy young men they snubbed so much before!"
4065,"the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his
pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him."
4066,"It takes
you three hours and a half to hear and enjoy an opera."
4067,"""No need at all,"" the Warden gently assented.
""Your husband and I have
gone through it together."
4068,"and the
King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to see who was
talking."
4069,"This way, my Lady,"" he added, ""this way!"""
4070,"""Can you play croquet?""
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her."
4071,"Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him.
She was rather
startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and
she was afraid that he really _was_ hurt this time."
4072,"And a great many voices all said together (“like the chorus
of a song,” thought Alice), “Don’t keep him waiting, child!"
4073,"She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in
her terror,
*      *      *      *      *      *      *
    *      *      *      *      *      *
*      *      *      *      *      *      *
and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet,
with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she
dropped to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to
shut out the dreadful uproar."
4074,"One other matter may perhaps seem to call for apology--that I should
have treated with such entire want of sympathy the British passion for
'Sport', which no doubt has been in by-gone days, and is still, in
some forms of it, an excellent school for hardihood and for coolness in
moments of danger."
4075,"“Further on, in the wood down there,
they’ve got no names—however, go on with your list of insects: you’re
wasting time.”
“Well, there’s the Horse-fly,” Alice began, counting off the names on
her fingers."
4076,"""till you had
seen more of her, and formed your own judgment of her: but somehow you
surprised it out of me."
4077,"“No, it can’t,” said the Queen.
“It’s jam every _other_ day: to-day
isn’t any _other_ day, you know.”
“I don’t understand you,” said Alice."
4078,"""I
must make the best of my time!""
AN OUTLANDISH WATCH."
4079,"And how that cupboard-door did creak!
It surely could not be Arthur, who
was opening and shutting it so often, moving so restlessly about, and
muttering like the soliloquy of a tragedy-queen!"
4080,"""Short partings are best,"" said the Warden.
""All is ready for my
journey."
4081,"All the
ashes will get into it—there, now I think you’re tidy enough!” she
added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the
Queen."
4082,"Thy brother, drowned in daily woe,
      Is thankful when thou sleepest;
   For if I laugh, however low,
      When thou’rt awake, thou weepest!"
4083,"""Why shouldn't I put one foot on the Fairy?""
""I don't know why,"" the little fellow said in a thoughtful tone."
4084,"""Sylvie--will--love--all.""
""Now you see the difference,"" said the old man: ""different colours and
different words."""
4085,"The 'march up' was a very curious sight:
{Image...The march-up}
a straggling procession of men, marching two and two, began from the
other side of the market-place, and advanced in an irregular zig-zag
fashion towards the Palace, wildly tacking from side to side, like a
sailing vessel making way against an unfavourable wind so that the head
of the procession was often further from us at the end of one tack than
it had been at the end of the previous one."
4086,"laughed Lady Muriel, as she sat down to the piano, and lightly struck a
few random chords."
4087,"I represented, modestly, that to my ears it appeared that they were
shouting for different things, but the Chancellor would not listen to my
suggestion for a moment."
4088,"I know there's one in about
an hour's time.""
""Perhaps that would be best,"" said the Earl."
4089,"“That’s just what I complain of,” said Humpty Dumpty."
4090,"We were silent for awhile, and then Arthur went off on another tack."
4091,"“_Now_ cut it up,” said the Lion, as she returned to her place
with the empty dish."
4092,"Shall she repeat it?”
“Her Red Majesty’s very kind to mention it,” the White Queen murmured
into Alice’s other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon."
4093,"Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt, and toe of frog,
Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,
Adder’s fork, and blind-worm’s sting,
Lizard’s leg, and howlet’s wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble."

4126,"What say you, can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,
And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen."
4127,"Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?"
4128,"Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?"

And by the way let us recount our dreams."

Look to the lady.
Why do we hold our tongues,
That most may claim this argument for ours?"
4137,"I’ll be with you straight.
Go a little before.
[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]
How all occasions do inform against me,
And spur my dull revenge."
4138,"Ay, my lord.
O God, your only jig-maker!
What should a man do but be merry?"
4139,"A dark Cave.
In the middle, a Cauldron Boiling.
Enter the three Witches."
4140,"Do you hear, let them be
well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time."
4141,"From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife."
4142,"Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
speech, enter into that brake; and so everyone according to his cue."
4143,"For love of God forbear him!
’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do:
Woul’t weep?"
4144,"Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal’d thee for herself."

Seek for thy noble father in the dust."

Ere I will yield my virgin patent up

My soul consents not to give sovereignty."

What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march?"

I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company."

It had been so with us, had we been there."

4160,"Is all the counsel that we two have shar’d,
The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent,

Hark you, sir.
What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?"
4190,"Fail not our feast.
My lord, I will not.
We hear our bloody cousins are bestow’d

Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up

’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark

extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of
such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable

4232,"It goes not forward, doth it?
It is not possible.
You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge
Pyramus but he."
4233,"Ere the bat hath flown
His cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons
The shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,
Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done

Let’s after him,
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
It is a peerless kinsman."
4235,"Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what’s in prayer but this twofold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon’d being down?"
4236,"And of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
It faded on the crowing of the cock."
4237,"With this there grows
In my most ill-compos’d affection such
A staunchless avarice, that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands;
Desire his jewels, and this other’s house:
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth."
4238,"It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on thy way to Mantua."
4239,"Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
I’ll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy;
And then I will her charmèd eye release
From monster’s view, and all things shall be peace."
4240,"Go, begone.
[_Exit second Servant._]
We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time."
4241,"O, then I see that mad men have no ears.
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?"
4242,"I hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid,
And not have strew’d thy grave."
4243,"I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw."

And then came Pyramus.
And so the lion vanished."

Nature shows art,
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart."

More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,

_Pros._ If I have too austerely punish'd you,

Or that for which I live; who once again
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations                              5
Were but my trials of thy love, and thou
Hast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven,
I ratify this my rich gift."
4294,"Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate that is meant love."
4295,"I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master
Peascod, your father."
4296,"I think, withal,
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here, from gracious England, have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed."

4298,"Why art thou here,
Come from the farthest steep of India,
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,

In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal."
4302,"Would thou hadst less deserv’d;
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine!"
4303,"But in our circumstance and course of thought,
’Tis heavy with him."
4304,"Look with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground.
But do not go with it."
4305,"Let four captains
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have prov’d most royally; and for his passage,
The soldiers’ music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him."
4306,"Mad let us grant him then.
And now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause."
4307,"He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the
circumference.
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present;
Myself the man i’ the moon do seem to be."
4308,"[_Exeunt._]
SCENE II.
Hall in Capulet’s House.
Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse and Servants."
4309,"Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!"
4310,"We cannot be here and there too.
Cheerly, boys.
Be brisk awhile, and
the longer liver take all."
4311,"So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:
They smack of honour both.—Go, get him surgeons."
4312,"The Witches dance, and vanish._]
MACBETH.
Where are they?
Gone?—Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!—
Come in, without there!"
4313,"To die, to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause."
4314,"Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale."
4315,"By the mass, I was about to say something.
Where did I leave?"
4316,"This by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy."
4317,"I will follow you.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady."
4318,"[_Exit._]
FIRST WITCH.
Come, let’s make haste; she’ll soon be back again."
4319,"[_Exeunt._]
BOTTOM.
[_Waking._] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer."
4320,"Is not this true?
_Ari._ Ay, sir.
_Pros._ This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child,
And here was left by the sailors."
4321,"Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,
With tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair."
4322,"If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town
(Where I did meet thee once with Helena
To do observance to a morn of May),
There will I stay for thee."
4323,"I am amazèd at your passionate words:
I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me."
4324,"As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him."
4325,"The worthy Thane of Ross.
What a haste looks through his eyes!
So should he look
That seems to speak things strange."
4326,"That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery
That aptly is put on."
4327,"_Enter TRINCULO._
                        Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me                       15
For bringing wood in slowly."
4328,"Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done.
For thou hast
more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my
whole five."
4329,"Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.
[_Exit._]
LADY MACDUFF."
4330,"Are we all met?
Pat, pat; and here’s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal."
4331,"And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee
simple of my life for an hour and a quarter."
4332,"take thou that.
[_Beats him._] As you
like this, give me the lie another time."
4333,"She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair."
4334,"Sailors, sir.
They say they have letters for you.
Let them come in."
4335,"More than to us
Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!"
4336,"I have liv’d long enough: my way of life
Is fall’n into the sere, the yellow leaf;
And that which should accompany old age,
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not."
4337,"By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
Till our scale turn the beam."
4338,"How long hath she been thus?
I hope all will be well.
We must be patient."
4339,"Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death."
4340,"Is it not like the King?
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he th’ambitious Norway combated;
So frown’d he once, when in an angry parle
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice."
4341,"Seyton!—
 Enter Seyton.
What’s your gracious pleasure?
What news more?"
4342,"“They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the
perfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge."
4343,"Send out more horses, skirr the country round;
Hang those that talk of fear."
4344,"Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
The moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye,
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
   Lamenting some enforced chastity."
4345,"God pardon him.
I do, with all my heart.
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart."
4346,"Buzz, buzz.
Upon my honour.
Then came each actor on his ass—
POLONIUS."
4347,"O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters."
4348,"What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
Ay, forsooth.
Well, he may chance to do some good on her."
4349,"More needs she the divine than the physician.—
God, God, forgive us all!"
4350,"Do not fret yourself too much in the
action, monsieur; and, good monsieur, have a care the honey-bag break
not; I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag, signior."
4351,"We will, my lord.
[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]
HAMLET.
What ho, Horatio!"
4352,"O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.
O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!"
4353,"Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled
valour, and in the grapple I boarded them."
4354,"My lord, do as you please,
But if you hold it fit, after the play,
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief, let her be round with him,
And I’ll be plac’d, so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference."
4355,"Keep promise, love.
Look, here comes Helena.
God speed fair Helena!"
4356,"how, in stripping it,
You more invest it!
Ebbing men, indeed,
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth."
4357,"342: _Which_] _Who_ Pope, and at line 351.
346: _thee_] om."
4358,"59: _Farewell, brother!_] _Brother, farewell!_ Theobald."
4359,"But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the morning’s love have oft made sport;
And, like a forester, the groves may tread
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams."
4360,"What I believe, I’ll wail;
What know, believe; and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will."
4361,"The heads of the maids?
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
thou wilt."
4362,"[_Exit._]
 SCENE V. Elsinore.
A room in the Castle.
Enter Queen, Horatio and a Gentleman."
4363,"Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,                   135
The clouds methought would open, and show riches
Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked,
I cried to dream again."
4364,"You are a tame man, go!
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr!"
4365,"We doubt it nothing.
What wood is this before us?
The wood of Birnam."
4366,"God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:
And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish."
4367,"He made you for a highway to my bed,
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed."
4368,"And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.
I’ll speak in a
monstrous little voice; ‘Thisne, Thisne!’—‘Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear!"
4369,"But ’tis strange:
And oftentimes to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths;
Win us with honest trifles, to betray’s
In deepest consequence.—
Cousins, a word, I pray you."
4370,"Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to
divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and yet
but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail."
4371,"_Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Sir, all this service                    225
Have I done since I went."
4372,"_Ari._                      I'll fetch them, sir.
[_Exit._
_Pros._ Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him                         35
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid--                           40
Weak masters though ye be--I have bedimm'd
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds."
4373,"Therefore no more, but to the matter.
My mother, you say,—
ROSENCRANTZ."
4374,"_Pros._                   Do so; and after two days
I will discharge thee.
_Ari._               That's my noble master!"
4375,"_nor_ F1 F2.
132: _fault_] _faults_ F4.
136: _who_] F2 F3 F4."
4376,"What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is’t that can inform me?"
4377,"And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,
With Ariadne and Antiopa?"
4378,"This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now
o’er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?"
4379,"Sing me now asleep;
Then to your offices, and let me rest."
4380,"Nay, as they dare.
I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to
them if they bear it."
4381,"He that’s coming
Must be provided for; and you shall put
This night’s great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom."
4382,"_Pros._              I am woe for't, sir.
_Alon._ Irreparable is the loss; and patience                      140
Says it is past her cure."
4383,"Hold, take my sword.—There’s husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out."
4384,"Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric and Attendants with foils &c.
KING."
4385,"221: _safely_] _safe_ F3 F4.
230: _of sleep_] _a-sleep_ Pope."
4386,"Thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it."
4387,"Shame come to Romeo.
Blister’d be thy tongue
For such a wish!"
4388,"Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchang’d love-tokens with my child."
4389,"[_Exit._]
BOTTOM.
I see their knavery.
This is to make an ass of me, to fright me, if
they could."
4390,"179: [Kneels] Theobald.
191: _advice_] F4.
_advise_ F1 F2 F3."
4391,"How now, my headstrong.
Where have you been gadding?
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
To beg your pardon."
4392,"Your royal father’s murder’d.
O, by whom?
Those of his chamber, as it seem’d, had done’t:
Their hands and faces were all badg’d with blood;
So were their daggers, which, unwip’d, we found
Upon their pillows."
4393,"Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale."
4394,"Lords, Gentlemen, Officers, Soldiers, Murderers, Attendants and
Messengers.
The Ghost of Banquo and several other Apparitions."
4395,"Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what’s done is done."
4396,"Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.
I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt."
4397,"An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung."
4398,"Come, go with me.
I will go seek the King.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself,
And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures."
4399,"And ere I take this charm from off her sight
(As I can take it with another herb)
I’ll make her render up her page to me."
4400,"I shall do so;
But I must also feel it as a man:
I cannot but remember such things were,
That were most precious to me.—Did heaven look on,
And would not take their part?"
4401,"So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun,
     An thou hadst not come to my bed."
4402,"[_Cries under the stage._] Swear.
Ha, ha boy, say’st thou so?"
4403,"A great suspicion.
Stay the Friar too.
Enter the Prince and Attendants."
4404,"Enter a Messenger.
Thou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly."
4405,"I did enact Julius Caesar.
I was kill’d i’ th’ Capitol."
4406,"If ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in a truth?"
4407,"For lo, his sword,
   Which was declining on the milky head
   Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick."
4408,"Good sir, whose powers are these?
They are of Norway, sir."
4409,"[_Aside._] O ’tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!"
4410,"_Ari._                          I go, I go.
[_Exit._
_Pros._ A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;                         190
And as with age his body uglier grows,
So his mind cankers."
4411,"Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm.
But I remember now
I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
Is often laudable; to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly:  why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defence,
To say I have done no harm?"
4412,"Know you not he has?
We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honour’d me of late; and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
Not cast aside so soon."
4413,"You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
What is Pyramus—a lover, or a tyrant?"
4414,"a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing.
For there is not a
more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to
it."
4415,"My love thou art, my love I think.
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace;
And like Limander am I trusty still."
4416,"To bed, to bed.
There’s knocking at the gate.
Come, come, come, come,
give me your hand."
4417,"Barnardo has my place.
Give you good-night.
[_Exit._]
MARCELLUS.
Holla, Barnardo!"
4418,"Enter lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia and Helena.
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth."
4419,"’Tis very strange.
As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it."
4420,"Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes.
When I
shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my
sudden and more strange return."
4421,"And so far blameless proves my enterprise
That I have ’nointed an Athenian’s eyes:
And so far am I glad it so did sort,
As this their jangling I esteem a sport."
4422,"_Seb._                      I have no hope
That he's undrown'd.
_Ant._             O, out of that 'no hope'                        230
What great hope have you!"
4423,"Well, sir?
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,—
HAMLET."
4424,"The first row of the pious chanson will show you more.
For look where
my abridgement comes."
4425,"Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect."
4426,"My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it nor can learn of him."
4427,"I fear it is.
And yet methinks it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man."
4428,"Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach."
4429,"_Pros._                    Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work."
4430,"If I do it, let
the audience look to their eyes.
I will move storms; I will condole in
some measure."
4431,"So that, I say,
He has borne all things well: and I do think,
That had he Duncan’s sons under his key
(As, and’t please heaven, he shall not) they should find
What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance."
4432,"That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.
What must be shall be."
4433,"His beard was grizzled, no?
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver’d."
4434,"I do forget.—
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me."
4435,"_Confin'd ... deserv'd_ id.
362: _Who ... prison_] om.
Pope (after Dryden)."
4436,"For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt."
4437,"Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes."
4438,"Farewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress."
4439,"What, ho!
You men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince."
4440,"_Pros._                 I rather think
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,
And rest myself content."
4441,"I’ll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord."
4442,"O Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits."
4443,"These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad."
4444,"I will apprehend him.
[_Advances._]
Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague."
4445,"Will it
please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between
two of our company?"
4446,"’Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatch’d?"
4447,"[_Sleeps._]
PUCK.
Yet but three?
Come one more.
Two of both kinds makes up four."
4448,"How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?
Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted."
4449,"She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience."
4450,"The King and Queen and all are coming down.
In happy time.
The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes
before you fall to play."
4451,"That’s all one.
You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small
as you will."
4452,"[_Soft music._
    _Enter IRIS._
  _Iris._ Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas                 60
    Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and pease;
    Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
    And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
    Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
    Which spongy April at thy best betrims,                         65
    To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,
    Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
    Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;
    And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
    Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,             70
    Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
    Bids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,
    Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
    To come and sport:--her peacocks fly amain:
    Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain."
4453,"_Seb._                    Please you, sir,
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:                                 185
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter."
4454,"Here’s such a coil.
Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?"
4455,"Be thou
as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny."
4456,"Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth, and tall,
And finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain;
Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
He bravely broach’d his boiling bloody breast;
And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died."
4457,"But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
I beseech you.
Being thus benetted round with villanies,—
Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
They had begun the play,—I sat me down,
Devis’d a new commission, wrote it fair:
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair, and labour’d much
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
It did me yeoman’s service."
4458,"This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own."
4459,"[_Knocking._] Knock, knock!
Who’s there, i’
th’ other devil’s name?"
4460,"Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
For certain, sir, he is not."
4461,"My lord, he hath importun’d me with love
In honourable fashion."
4462,"Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son."
4463,"But come young waverer, come go with me,
In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households’ rancour to pure love."
4464,"But it was—as I received it, and others,
whose judgements in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent
play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as
cunning."
4465,"Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service; there resides,                        65
To make me slave to it; and for your sake
Am I this patient log-man."
4466,"He loves us not:
He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl."
4467,"Great business must be wrought ere noon.
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vap’rous drop profound;
I’ll catch it ere it come to ground:
And that, distill’d by magic sleights,
Shall raise such artificial sprites,
As, by the strength of their illusion,
Shall draw him on to his confusion."
4468,"Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.
True, my lord.
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my near’st of life; and though I could
With barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down: and thence it is
That I to your assistance do make love,
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons."
4469,"As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand
Murder’d her kinsman."
4470,"And let those that play your clowns speak no
more than is set down for them."
4471,"LENNOX, Nobleman of Scotland.
ROSS, Nobleman of Scotland.
MENTEITH, Nobleman of Scotland."
4472,"’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague."
4473,"Come, go with me.
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay."
4474,"I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring."
4475,"I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
That it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his
lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs
sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him."

    _Enter CERES._
  _Cer._ Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
    Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
    Who, with thy saffron wings, upon my flowers
    Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers;
    And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown                    80
    My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
    Rich scarf to my proud earth;--why hath thy queen
    Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?"
4481,"Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you."
4482,"Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief."
4483,"Enter Capulet and Nurse.
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother’s son
It rains downright."
4484,"Enter a Messenger.
What is your tidings?
The King comes here tonight."
4485,"Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.

The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely order'd, that there is no soul,
No, not so much perdition as an hair                                30
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink."
4486,"In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state."
4487,"Alas, then she is drown’d?
Drown’d, drown’d."
4488,"How's the day?
_Ari._ On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
You said our work should cease."

That is the true beginning of our end."
4490,"_Ay?_ Pope.

_my doublet, sir_ F2 F3 F4."
4491,"And I am sick when I look not on you.
You do impeach your modesty too much
To leave the city and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not,
To trust the opportunity of night
And the ill counsel of a desert place,
With the rich worth of your virginity."
4492,"Thou’dst have, great Glamis,
That which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do,
Than wishest should be undone."
4493,"You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone."

Ah what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance?"
4496,"My lord, his throat is cut.
That I did for him.
Thou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats;
Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance:
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil."

POLONIUS.
What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?"
4498,"_Ste._ Be you quiet, monster.
Mistress line, is not this
my jerkin?"
4499,"For mine own good,
All causes shall give way: I am in blood
Stepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o’er."
4500,"_Ari._ I drink the air before me, and return
Or ere your pulse twice beat."
4501,"Thou shalt be free.
_Alon._ This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod;
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge."
4502,"And she goes down at twelve.
I take’t, ’tis later, sir."

 _Burthen_ [_dispersedly_].
Hark, hark!
The watch-dogs bark:

4504,"Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff:
Seyton, send out.—Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.—
Come, sir, despatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo,
That should applaud again.—Pull’t off, I say.—
What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,
Would scour these English hence?"
4505,"Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense."
4506,"Now all is well.
One aloof stand sentinel.
[_Exeunt Fairies.

4507,"_Seb._ Of that there's none, or little.
_Gon._ How lush and lusty the grass looks!"
4508,"When did you lose you daughter?
_Pros._ In this last tempest.
I perceive, these lords
At this encounter do so much admire,
That they devour their reason, and scarce think                    155
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
Been justled from your senses, know for certain
That I am Prospero, and that very duke
Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely                160
Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
To be the Lord on't."
4509,"You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency;
That’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty;
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault."
4510,"Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee."
4511,"_Ant._                Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking."
4512,"And so do I.
Let’s briefly put on manly readiness,
And meet i’ th’ hall together."
4513,"When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me, and madest much of me; wouldst give me
Water with berries in't; and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,                        335
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee,
And show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Curs'd be I that did so!"
4514,"If it be mine,
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it."

4517,"Why, what a king is this!
Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,—
He that hath kill’d my king, and whor’d my mother,
Popp’d in between th’election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience
To quit him with this arm?"
4518,"Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive."

 Alarums.
That way the noise is.—Tyrant, show thy face!"
4521,"What say you, Hermia?
Be advis’d, fair maid.
To you your father should be as a god;
One that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted, and within his power
To leave the figure, or disfigure it."
4522,"He does confess he feels himself distracted,
But from what cause he will by no means speak."
4523,"Nor time nor place
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Does unmake you."
4524,"Now, mother, what’s the matter?
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended."
4525,"_Cal._ Prithee, my king, be quiet.
See'st thou here,
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter."
4526,"Now near enough.
Your leafy screens throw down,
And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle,
Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon’s what else remains to do,
According to our order."
4527,"All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!"
4528,"Tongue, not a word:
             Come, trusty sword,
         Come, blade, my breast imbrue;
             And farewell, friends."
4529,"This is for all.
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
Have you so slander any moment leisure
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet."
4530,"We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee."
4531,"Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
For what, I pray thee?"
4532,"Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,
Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course."
4533,"Enter Juliet above.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed."
4534,"Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near."
4535,"So I lose none
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
My bosom franchis’d, and allegiance clear,
I shall be counsell’d."
4536,"What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night."
4537,"I prythee, when thou see’st that act a-foot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle."
4538,"Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce."
4539,"you make me study of
that: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis."
4540,"I will roar that I will do any man’s heart
good to hear me."
4541,"O, I die, Horatio.
The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit:
I cannot live to hear the news from England,
But I do prophesy th’election lights
On Fortinbras."
4542,"You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,
And, would it were not so."
4543,"I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,                   355
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them known."

I needs must rest me.

Who am myself attach'd with weariness,                               5
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest."
4548,"I think not of them:
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that business,
If you would grant the time."
4549,"If’t be so,
For Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind;
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man,
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!"

That you should here repent you,
The actors are at hand, and, by their show,
You shall know all that you are like to know."
4555,"O, these flaws, and starts
(Impostors to true fear), would well become
A woman’s story at a winter’s fire,
Authoris’d by her grandam."
4556,"For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him that he is young;
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you."
4557,"What is’t you say?
Mean you his majesty?
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon."
4558,"Are you sure
That we are awake?
It seems to me
That yet we sleep, we dream."

Upon my life, Lamond.
The very same."

BENVOLIO, nephew to Montague, and friend to Romeo."

4564,"There’s warrant in that theft
Which steals itself, when there’s no mercy left."
4565,"I’ll charm the air to give a sound,
While you perform your antic round;
That this great king may kindly say,
Our duties did his welcome pay."
4566,"I bought an unction of a mountebank
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
This is but scratch’d withal."
4567,"_Ste._ So is mine.
Do you hear, monster?
If I should               200
take a displeasure against you, look you,--
_Trin._ Thou wert but a lost monster."
4568,"Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.
[_Laying Paris in the monument._]
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry!"
4569,"How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
Seem to me all the uses of this world!"
4570,"How doth my lady?
Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet?"
4571,"I am thy father’s spirit,
Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confin’d to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purg’d away."
4572,"Then I beat my tabor;                       175
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears,
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears,
That, calf-like, they my lowing follow'd through
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,           180
Which enter'd their frail shins: at last I left them
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
O'erstunk their feet."
4573,"_Ari._ Is there more toil?
Since thou dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
Which is not yet perform'd me."

Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love."
4576,"Well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me.
But as I said,
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well."
4577,"What does the tyrant?
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say he’s mad; others, that lesser hate him,
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
He cannot buckle his distemper’d cause
Within the belt of rule."

I'll carry it to the pile."
4587,"_Ari._                              Pardon, master:
I will be correspondent to command,
And do my spiriting gently."
4588,"There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death."
4589,"Enter Nurse, with cords.
Now, Nurse, what news?
What hast thou there?"
4590,These vows are Hermia’s: will you give her o’er?
4591,"O, how my heart abhors
To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him."
4592,"look how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he liv’d!"
4593,"For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again."
4594,"Sense sure you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
Is apoplex’d, for madness would not err
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d
But it reserv’d some quantity of choice
To serve in such a difference."
4595,"_Ste._ Give me thy hand.
I do begin to have bloody
thoughts.

_Trin._ O King Stephano!"
4596,"Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,
And therefore have I little talk’d of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears."
4597,"Here lay Duncan,
His silver skin lac’d with his golden blood;
And his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature
For ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
Steep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breech’d with gore."
4598,"Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep."
4599,"who, were’t so,
Would have inform’d for preparation."
4600,"Indeed la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t."
4601,"General Notes are in their original location at the end of the play.

Finding it so inclin’d."

Friar Lawrence’s cell.
Enter Friar Lawrence."
4605,"_Seb._ No marrying 'mong his subjects?
_Ant._ None, man; all idle; whores and knaves."
4606,"Alas, poor ghost!
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold."
4607,"_Alon._              No, no, he's gone.
_Seb._ Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she, at least, is banish'd from your eye,                    120
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't."
4608,"We will ourselves provide.
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your Majesty."
4609,"To cut his throat i’ th’ church.
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Revenge should have no bounds."
4610,"I have had a most rare vision.
I have had a dream, past the wit
of man to say what dream it was."
4611,"Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?"
4612,"Are
they so followed?
No, indeed, they are not.
How comes it?"
4613,"A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it then!"
4614,"Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale.
I tell you

4618,"where is thy blush?
Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire."
4619,"That we would do,
We should do when we would; for this ‘would’ changes,
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
And then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh
That hurts by easing."
4620,"Resolve yourselves apart.
I’ll come to you anon.
We are resolv’d, my lord."
4621,"Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Barnardo speak of this."
4622,"And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck’d the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh,
That unmatch’d form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy."
4623,"Not a jot more, my lord.
Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?"
4624,"But yet
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Let shame say what it will."
4625,"Sojourn in Mantua.
I’ll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here."
4626,"More validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo."
4627,"Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
’Tis brief, my lord."
4628,"Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing."
4629,"Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?
_Pros._ Thou hadst, and more, Miranda."
4630,"Came he not home tonight?
Not to his father’s; I spoke with his man."
4631,"Till I know ’tis done,
Howe’er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun."
4632,"Tender yourself more dearly;
Or,—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Roaming it thus,—you’ll tender me a fool."

A public Place.
Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants."
4634,"They star’d, and were distracted;
No man’s life was to be trusted with them."
4635,"Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership."
4636,"_Pros._                  Hast thou, spirit,
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?"
4637,"_Pros._                Thou shalt be as free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command."
4638,"His horses go about.
Almost a mile; but he does usually,
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
Make it their walk."
4639,"Which way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?"
4640,"_Mir._                   More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
_Pros._                          'Tis time
I should inform thee farther."
4641,"When in your motion you are hot and dry,
As make your bouts more violent to that end,
And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepar’d him
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,
Our purpose may hold there."
4642,"For there be of them that will
themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then
to be considered."
4643,"for even now
I put myself to thy direction, and
Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
For strangers to my nature."
4644,"Shrug'st thou, malice?
If thou neglect'st, or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,                     370
That beasts shall tremble at thy din."
4645,"[_A noise within._]
QUEEN.
Alack, what noise is this?
Where are my Switzers?"
4646,"Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s
house."
4647,"What, Nurse, I say!
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up."
4648,"Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will."
4649,"Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.
_Mir._                        'Tis far off,
And rather like a dream than an assurance                           45
That my remembrance warrants."
4650,"Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Yes, it is already garrison’d."
4651,"I am but mad north-north-west.
When the wind is southerly, I know a
hawk from a handsaw."
4652,"_Trin._ Why, what did I?
I did nothing.
I'll go farther
off."
4653,"Stop there, stop there.
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair."
4654,"Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes?
If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,
And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it."
4655,"But come,
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself,—
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on—
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With arms encumber’d thus, or this head-shake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As ‘Well, we know’, or ‘We could and if we would’,
Or ‘If we list to speak’; or ‘There be and if they might’,
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me:—this not to do."
4656,"[_Reads_] ‘The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.’
We’ll none of that."
4657,"Be comforted:
Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,
To cure this deadly grief."
4658,"You told us of some suit.
What is’t, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And lose your voice."
4659,"Will money buy 'em?
_Ant._            Very like; one of them                           265
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable."
4660,"From this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand."
4661,"What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?"
4662,"Why how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night."
4663,"Now is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin,          235
you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin."
4664,"Enter Horatio and a Servant.
What are they that would speak with me?"
4665,"460: Pros.
prefixed again to this line in Ff.
468: _and_] _tho'_ Hanmer."
4666,"Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!"
4667,"[_Sings._]
   But age with his stealing steps
     Hath claw’d me in his clutch,
   And hath shipp’d me into the land,
     As if I had never been such."
4668,"Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of the
ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream."
4669,"Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.
Help, help!"
4670,"_Mir._             I do not know
One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen                      50
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father: how features are abroad,
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you;                                 55
Nor can imagination form a shape,
Besides yourself, to like of."
4671,"Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again."
4672,"Thou shalt buy this dear
If ever I thy face by daylight see:
Now go thy way."
4673,"My worthy Cawdor!
[_Aside._] The Prince of Cumberland!—That is a step
On which I must fall down, or else o’erleap,
For in my way it lies."
4674,"By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes."
4675,"Dismay’d not this
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
Yes;
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion."
4676,"78: _me_] om.
80: _whom ... whom_] F2 F3 F4."
4677,"What, Ariel!
my industrious servant, Ariel!
_Enter ARIEL._
_Ari._ What would my potent master?"
4678,"Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
Heavens make our presence and our practices
Pleasant and helpful to him."
4679,"Is’t far you ride?
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
’Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night,
For a dark hour or twain."
4680,"Mine ache to think on’t.
[_Sings._]
   A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
     For and a shrouding-sheet;
   O, a pit of clay for to be made
     For such a guest is meet."
4681,"[_Exit._]
CAPULET.
Mass and well said; a merry whoreson, ha."
4682,"How otherwise?—
Will you be rul’d by me?
Ay, my lord;
So you will not o’errule me to a peace."
4683,"The Prince will doom thee death
If thou art taken.
Hence, be gone, away!"
4684,"I’ll send my prayers with him.
[_Exeunt._]
ACT IV
SCENE I."
4685,"_on, by this light.
--Thou_ Capell.
25: _debauched_] _debosh'd_ Ff."
4686,"_Mir._ The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.
_Pros._        Shake it off."
4687,"Speak, if you can;—what are you?
All hail, Macbeth!"
4688,"Hall in Capulet’s House.
Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.
Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse."
4689,"Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on
the tongue."
4690,"[_Dies._]
HAMLET.
Heaven make thee free of it!
I follow thee."
4691,"Let’s further think of this,
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape."
4692,"Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower,
Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,
And maidens call it love-in-idleness."
4693,"O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom."
4694,"Possibly it ought to be printed thus:
              'Do so; and
  After two days
  I will discharge thee.'"
4695,"List’ning their fear, I could not say “Amen,”
When they did say, “God bless us.”
LADY MACBETH."
4696,"9: _remove_] _move_ Pope.
14: _labours_] _labour_ Hanmer.
15: _Most busy lest_] F1."
4697,"So you shall.
And where th’offence is let the great axe fall."
4698,"[_Exit._]
LADY MACDUFF.
Sirrah, your father’s dead.
And what will you do now?"
4699,"What soldiers, whey-face?
The English force, so please you.
Take thy face hence."
4700,"Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back."
4701,"Let it work;
For ’tis the sport to have the enginer
Hoist with his own petard, and ’t shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines
And blow them at the moon."
4702,"She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O she’s rich in beauty, only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store."
4703,"This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
He did comply with his dug before he suck’d it."
4704,"Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amaz’d me."
4705,"Come hither, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword.
Never to speak of this that you have heard."
4706,"Silence awhile.—Robin, take off this head.
Titania, music call; and strike more dead
Than common sleep, of all these five the sense."
4707,"It must be _se offendendo_, it cannot be else.
For here lies the point:
if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three
branches."
4708,"Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you.
Then be content."
4709,"[_Exit._]
KING.
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him."
4710,"Last night of all,
When yond same star that’s westward from the pole,
Had made his course t’illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one—
MARCELLUS."
4711,"’Twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile and mark.
[_Retiring with Horatio._]
LAERTES."
4712,"That it should come to this!
But two months dead—nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was to this
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly."
4713,"Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians.
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?"
4714,"That would be scann’d:
A villain kills my father, and for that
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
To heaven."
4715,"Get thee to bed.
[_Exit Servant._]
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand?"
4716,"135: _to 't_] om.
Steevens (Farmer conj.).
138: _Wherefore_] _Why_ Pope."
4717,"If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords."
4718,"What, look’d he frowningly?
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger."
4719,"My father
Is hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself;                         20
He's safe for these three hours."
4720,"‘The mobled queen’?
That’s good!
‘Mobled queen’ is good."
4721,"He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him."
4722,"So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
Marry, well bethought:
’Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous."
4723,"I warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady."
4724,"And why, my lady wisdom?
Hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go."
4725,"[_Dies._]
ROMEO.
In faith, I will.
Let me peruse this face."
4726,"Well; again.
Stay, give me drink.
Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Here’s to thy health."
4727,"The King my father!
Season your admiration for a while
With an attent ear, till I may deliver
Upon the witness of these gentlemen
This marvel to you."
4728,"[_Exit Ariel._] How fares my gracious sir?
There are yet missing of your company
Some few odd lads that you remember not."
4729,"Thou, my slave,                  270
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers,                              275
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died,
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans              280
As fast as mill-wheels strike."
4730,"All which, sir, though I most powerfully and
potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down."
4731,"And we fairies, that do run
      By the triple Hecate’s team
   From the presence of the sun,
      Following darkness like a dream,
   Now are frolic; not a mouse
      Shall disturb this hallow’d house."
4732,"She speaks, yet she says nothing.
What of that?
Her eye discourses, I will answer it."
4733,"Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir."
4734,"Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not."
4735,[_Aside._] It is the poison’d cup; it is too late.
4736,"Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode?"
4737,"_Mir._ At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
What I desire to give; and much less take
What I shall die to want."
4738,"[_Knocking within._]
Wake Duncan with thy knocking!
I would thou couldst!"
4739,"_Pros._ [_Aside_]      It works.
[_To Fer._] Come on.
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!"
4740,"How chances it they travel?
Their residence, both in reputation and
profit, was better both ways."
4741,"Either death or you I’ll find immediately.
[_Exit._]
ACT III
SCENE I."
4742,"_
A fair assembly.
[_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?"
4743,"175: _hey-day_] Rowe.
_Before PROSPERO'S cell._
  _Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log._
_Fer._ There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
Point to rich ends."
4744,"I swoon almost with fear.
Then I well perceive you are not nigh."
4745,"The defect, indeed, in the metre of line
298 has not been noticed except by Hanmer, who makes a line thus:
  'Do so, and after two days I'll discharge thee.'"
4746,"The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon
by our sides."
4747,"An open Place.
A Camp near Forres.
A Room in the Palace."
4748,"Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?"
4749,"_Pros._ [_Aside_] It goes on, I see,
As my soul prompts it."
4750,"Hark, again.
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me."
4751,"The Weird Sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about:
Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
And thrice again, to make up nine."
4752,"Prospero, too, repeats his promise,
and marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude,
'within two days,' I."
4753,"O, I am fortune’s fool!
Why dost thou stay?
[_Exit Romeo._]
 Enter Citizens."
4754,"Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
I would not wish them to a fairer death:
And so his knell is knoll’d."
4755,"Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father."
4756,"But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight."
4757,"Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a
fish and half a monster?"
4758,"Th’ attempt and not the deed
Confounds us.—Hark!—I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss ’em.—Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done’t.—My husband!"
4759,"[_Exit._]
JULIET.
Then, window, let day in, and let life out."
4760,"Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.
It may be so, for it is not mine own."
4761,"Enter Oberon and Titania with their Train.
Through the house give glimmering light,
        By the dead and drowsy fire."
4762,"If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an honest Puck,
   If we have unearnèd luck
   Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,
   We will make amends ere long;
   Else the Puck a liar call."
4763,"Hast thou no mouth by land?
What is the news?
220
_Boats._ The best news is, that we have safely found
Our king and company; the next, our ship--
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd, as when
We first put out to sea."
4764,"With all my heart; and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclin’d."
4765,"You see, her eyes are open.
Ay, but their sense are shut."
4766,"They have letters for him.
Ere we were
two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
chase."
4767,"[_They wake._
_Alon._ Why, how now?
ho, awake!--Why are you drawn?"
4768,"In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d."
4769,"hast thou forgot her?
_Ari._ No, sir.
_Pros._       Thou hast.
Where was she born?"
4770,"_Cal._          I shall be pinch'd to death.
_Alon._ Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?"
4771,"If this should fail,
And that our drift look through our bad performance."
4772,"Which of you have done this?
What, my good lord?
Thou canst not say I did it."
4773,"Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.
My legs are longer though, to run away."
4774,"My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus’ nuptial day."
4775,"This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but                               5
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed."
4776,"Where is my father?
But not by him.
Let him demand his fill."
4777,"_Most busy felt_ Staunton.
_Most busy still_ Staunton conj.
_Most busy-blest_ Collier MS. _Most busiliest_ Bullock conj."
4778,"Well what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true."
4779,"I dare damnation.
To this point I stand,
That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
Let come what comes; only I’ll be reveng’d
Most throughly for my father."
4780,"Indeed the top of admiration!
worth
What's dearest to the world!
Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard, and many a time                       40
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
Have I liked several women; never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,                        45
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature's best!"
4781,"Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it."
4782,"Ay, do.
Persever, counterfeit sad looks,
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up."
4783,"Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where for this many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort—
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad."
4784,"Had he his hurts before?
Ay, on the front.
Why then, God’s soldier be he!"
4785,"To me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow, and which will not,
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate."
4786,"You spotted snakes with double tongue,
       Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
    Newts and blind-worms do no wrong,
       Come not near our Fairy Queen:
CHORUS."
4787,"Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud?
Doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?"
4788,"This man shall set me packing.
I’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room."
4789,"Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry."
4790,"_And by that
    destin'd to perform_ Musgrave conj.
_(And that by destiny)
    to perform_ Staunton conj."
4791,"_Cal._ That's not the tune.
[_Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe._
_Ste._ What is this same?"
4792,"Beetles black, approach not near;
       Worm nor snail do no offence.
Philomel with melody, &c.
SECOND FAIRY."
4793,"Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,—
FIRST CLOWN.
Give me leave."
4794,"Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads."
4795,"_Boats._ None that I more love than myself.
You are a
Counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence,           20
and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope
more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you
have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin
for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap."
4796,"I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,
As well possess’d; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius’;
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia."
4797,"If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story."
4798,"Heaven is here
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her,
But Romeo may not."
4799,"What, are they children?
Who maintains ’em?
How are they escoted?"
4800,"I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
That’s by me wounded."
4801,"O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath prais’d him with above compare
So many thousand times?"
4802,"Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there."
4803,"Enter Nurse and Peter.
O God, she comes.
O honey Nurse, what news?"
4804,"Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
False face must hide what the false heart doth know."
4805,"Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promis’d march
Over his kingdom."
4806,"’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites."
4807,"Enter Demetrius and Hermia.
This is the same Athenian.
This is the woman, but not this the man."
4808,"The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history,
pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem
unlimited."

Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
With dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews
With aged cramps; and more pinch-spotted make them
Then pard or cat o' mountain."
4810,"Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.
So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe;
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
If for his tender here I make some stay."
4811,"Here she comes, curst and sad.
Cupid is a knavish lad
    Thus to make poor females mad."

Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word."

This nothing’s more than matter."
4818,"Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others.
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?"
4819,"This day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;
This but begins the woe others must end."
4820,"All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of."

That will ask some tears in the true performing of it."
4826,"O rose of May!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits
Should be as mortal as an old man’s life?"

But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl."

I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it

4840,"I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
Let her not hurt me."
4841,"But orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown."

The more I have, for both are infinite."
4845,"Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,
Bestride our down-fall’n birthdom."
4846,"You speak like a green girl,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?"
4847,"I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and
put up my iron dagger."
4848,"O, that you bore
The mind that I do!
what a sleep were this
For your advancement!"
4849,"What would your gracious figure?
Alas, he’s mad.
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command?"
4850,"God save the King!
Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?
From Fife, great King,
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold."
4851,"[_Exit Friar Lawrence._]
What’s here?
A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?"
4852,"Thou told’st me they were stol’n into this wood,
And here am I, and wode within this wood
Because I cannot meet with Hermia."
4853,"Makes marriage vows
As false as dicers’ oaths.
O such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words."
4854,"When was it she last walked?
Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her
bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,
fold it, write upon’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to
bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep."
4855,"So did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark’d about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
All my smooth body."
4856,"Indeed,
to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for
you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see."

When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they
unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing."
4861,"All these are portable,
With other graces weigh’d.
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them; but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways."
4862,"How did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death;
And I, the mistress of your charms,
The close contriver of all harms,
Was never call’d to bear my part,
Or show the glory of our art?"
4863,"_Mir._                    I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons."
4864,"I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Marry, I’ll teach you; think yourself a baby;
That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling."
4865,"Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius."
4866,"If, rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That cop’st with death himself to scape from it."

4872,"I hope she
will be brief.
A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the
better: he for a man, God warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us!"
4873,"Long stay’d he so,
At last,—a little shaking of mine arm,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being."
4874,"Just in her case!
O woeful sympathy!
Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering."
4875,"_Alon._ Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
_Gon._ I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister     165

names of the actors; and so grow to a point."
4882,"Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery."
4883,"_Pros._                   Hear a little further,                   135

In every point twice done, and then done double,
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your Majesty loads our house: for those of old,
And the late dignities heap’d up to them,
We rest your hermits."
4900,"Sinful Macduff,
They were all struck for thee!
Naught that I am,
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!"
4901,"Bring him before us.
Ho, Guildenstern!
Bring in my lord.
Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern."
4902,"Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do’t."
4903,"We have lost your son,           125
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault's your own."
4904,"Proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
And reason panders will."
4905,"’Tide life, ’tide death, I come without delay.
Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go."
4906,"Will it not be receiv’d,
When we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber, and us’d their very daggers,
That they have done’t?"
4907,"Spakest thou of Juliet?
How is it with her?
Doth not she think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy
With blood remov’d but little from her own?"
4908,"Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!"
4909,"Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel."
4910,"’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.
No, faith, not a jot."

Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition;
Nor would we deign him burial of his men

Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come."
4924,"Of him, sir.
I know you are not ignorant,—
HAMLET."
4925,"O happy fair!
Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear."
4926,"I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?"
4927,"Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending."
4928,"Give me my armour.
’Tis not needed yet.
I’ll put it on."

4932,"If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
Being o’er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
And kill me too."
4933,"Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.
Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,
For you and I are past our dancing days;
How long is’t now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?"
4934,"Cool it with a baboon’s blood.
Then the charm is firm and good."
4935,"Nay, good my lord.
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would
perhaps trouble a woman."
4936,"Good night, sweet prince,
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest."
4937,"What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well;
He hath not touch’d you yet."
4938,"We’ll answer.
Say, if thou’dst rather hear it from our mouths,
Or from our masters?"
4939,"I have seen nothing.
Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us."
4940,"All is confirm’d, my lord, which was reported.
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack’d."
4941,"Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties                    110
He thinks me now incapable; confederates,
So dry he was for sway, wi' the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
The dukedom, yet unbow'd,--alas, poor Milan!--                     115
To most ignoble stooping."
4942,"Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with!"
4943,"Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalu’d persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The sanctity and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head."
4944,"Rowe's reading 'princes' might be defended on the ground that the
sentiment is general, and applicable to royal children of both sexes; or
that Sir Philip Sidney, in the first book of the _Arcadia_, calls Pamela
and Philoclea 'princes.'"
4945,"I’ll give thee a wind.
Th’art kind.
And I another."
4946,"It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone."
4947,"But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as
lief the town-crier spoke my lines."
4948,"With this field-dew consecrate,
   Every fairy take his gait,
   And each several chamber bless,
   Through this palace, with sweet peace;
   And the owner of it blest."
4949,"O most happy hour!
Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if I tell
you, I am not true Athenian."
4950,"Be this the whetstone of your sword.
Let grief
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it."
4951,"How long is that since?
Cannot you tell that?
Every fool can tell that."
4952,"I hear some noise within.
Dear love, adieu.

Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,

Enter Hamlet and Horatio."
4985,"How now, how now, chopp’d logic?
What is this?"
4986,"’Tis unnatural,
Even like the deed that’s done.
On Tuesday last,
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
Was by a mousing owl hawk’d at and kill’d."
4987,"The King hath happily receiv’d, Macbeth,
The news of thy success, and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his: silenc’d with that,
In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death."
4988,"Vile thing, let loose,
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent."
4989,"_Pros._              First, noble friend,                          120
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
Be measured or confined."
4990,"I hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir.
O reform it altogether."
4991,"Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but
in’s own house."
4992,"_o'th state_ F3 F4.
88: _O, good sir ... mark me._] _Good sir ... mark me then._ Pope."
4993,"Wilt thou be pleased to
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?"
4994,"Here lies the water; good.
Here stands the man; good.
If
the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he
goes,—mark you that."
4995,"It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass
for excellent men."
4996,"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?"
4997,"Do I entice you?
Do I speak you fair?
Or rather do I not in plainest truth
Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?"
4998,"To feed were best at home;
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it."
4999,"O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities."
5000,"_Mir._                 Never till this day
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd."
5001,"I'll fall flat;
Perchance he will not mind me.
_Trin._ Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any
weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i'
the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks               20
like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor."
5002,"Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!
_Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO,
  and others._
_Alon._ Good boatswain, have care."
5003,"213: _When_] _Where_ Johnson conj.]
_and_] om.
216: SCENE V. Pope."
5004,"_Ste._ I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country."
5005,"I have no words;
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out!"
5006,"312: _verily_] _verity_ Pope.
_upon our guard_] _on guard_ Pope."
5007,"Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
As the Weird Women promis’d; and, I fear,
Thou play’dst most foully for’t; yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity;
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings."
5008,"How oddly thou repliest.
‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
‘Where is your mother?’
NURSE."
5009,"Say, how came you hither?
_Boats._ If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
I'ld strive to tell you."
5010,"See note (I).
31:  [Exeunt] Theobald.
33: _Bring her to try_] F4."
5011,"Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And drive his purpose on to these delights."
5012,"O heat, dry up my brains.
Tears seven times salt,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye."
5013,"‘A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.’
Merry and tragical?"
5014,"There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream."
5015,"Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,             25
Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury
Do I take part: the rarer action is
In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Not a frown further."
5016,"Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that."
5017,"When I did him at this advantage take,
An ass’s nole I fixed on his head."
5018,"Jove's lightnings, the precursors
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,                  205
Yea, his dread trident shake."
5019,"Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you."
5020,"How purpos’d, sir, I pray you?
Against some part of Poland."
5021,"_Seb._ Or stole it, rather.
[_Exeunt Cal., Ste., and Trin._
_Pros._ Sir, I invite your Highness and your train                 300
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
Go quick away: the story of my life,
And the particular accidents gone by                               305
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
I'll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
And thence retire me to my Milan, where                            310
Every third thought shall be my grave."
5022,"231: _Who_] _Whom_ Hanmer.
234: _are_] _all_ Collier MS.
  _upon_] _on_ Pope."
5023,"_Seb._                         I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language, and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep."
5024,"A room in the Castle
 Scene VI.
Another room in the Castle
 Scene VII."
5025,"only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay."
5026,"_Cal._ Lo, lo, again!
bite him to death, I prithee."
5027,"First rehearse your song by rote,
        To each word a warbling note;
   Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
   Will we sing, and bless this place."
5028,"Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
It is enough I may but call her mine."
5029,"There’s a daisy.
I would give you some
violets, but they wither’d all when my father died."
5030,"[_Exit above._
_Gon._ I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
In this strange stare?"
5031,"Whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear’st something approach."
5032,"[_Exit Horatio._]
[_To Laertes_]
Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech;
We’ll put the matter to the present push.—
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son."
5033,"If there come truth from them
(As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope?"
5034,"Woul’t drink up eisel?
eat a crocodile?
I’ll do’t."
5035,"_Ste._ O brave monster!
Lead the way.
[_Exeunt._
  Notes: II, 2."
5036,"Meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion."
5037,"Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
ACT III
Scene I.
A public Place."
5038,"SNOUT
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
A calendar, a calendar!"
5039,"How stand I then,
That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide the slain?"
5040,"_Adr._ Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon
to their queen.
70
_Gon._ Not since widow Dido's time."
5041,"If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
5042,"Wast thou with Rosaline?
With Rosaline, my ghostly father?
I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe."
5043,"Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague."
5044,"I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee."
5045,"speak, speak!
I charge thee speak!
[_Exit Ghost._]
MARCELLUS."
5046,"But ’tis not so above;
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature, and we ourselves compell’d
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence."
5047,"I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
Mine ear is much enamour’d of thy note."
5048,"_Cal._ Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly."
5049,"Speak, I am bound to hear.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear."
5050,"Weaving spiders, come not here;
       Hence, you long-legg’d spinners, hence."
5051,"And we will hear it.
No, my noble lord,
It is not for you: I have heard it over,
And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
Unless you can find sport in their intents,
Extremely stretch’d and conn’d with cruel pain
To do you service."
5052,"_Alon._                      If this prove                         175
A vision of the island, one dear son
Shall I twice lose."
5053,"Now, good Peter
Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.
Masters, spread
yourselves."
5054,"Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Throttle their practis’d accent in their fears,
And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
Not paying me a welcome."
5055,"_Fer._ The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
405
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes:--I hear it now above me."
5056,"[_Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius._]
ACT IV
SCENE I.
A room in the Castle."
5057,"Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield
us!)"
5058,"[_Exit Horatio._]
O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
All from her father’s death."
5059,"_than to_] _than I would_ Pope.
72: _what else_] _aught else_ Malone conj."
5060,"If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe."
5061,"Could he dig without arms?
I’ll put another
question to thee."
5062,"No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men
are’: and there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly
he is Snug the joiner."
5063,"_Pros._                             And mine shall.
20
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?"
5064,"Make haste I say.
[_Exeunt._]
SCENE V. Juliet’s Chamber; Juliet on the bed."
5065,"SIWARD, Earl of Northumberland, General of the English Forces.
YOUNG SIWARD, his Son."
5066,"[_Exit._]
SCENE II.
Another Room in the Palace.
Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant."
5067,"And a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier
than he is, and twenty such Jacks."
5068,"My name’s Macbeth.
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear."
5069,"Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
Have banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!"
5070,"I
will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be
called ‘Bottom’s Dream’, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it
in the latter end of a play, before the Duke."
5071,"I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come, death, and welcome."
5072,"Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,
And as my love is siz’d, my fear is so."
5073,"180
Arise, and say how thou camest here.
_Mir._                             O, wonder!"
5074,"His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all
disordered."
5075,"Look where he goes even now out at the portal.
[_Exit Ghost._]
QUEEN."
5076,"What players are they?
Even those you were wont to take such delight in—the tragedians of the
city."
5077,"ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore.
A platform before the Castle.
Enter Francisco and Barnardo, two sentinels."
5078,"If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overcharg’d with double cracks;
So they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
Or memorize another Golgotha,
I cannot tell—
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help."
5079,"MARINE is about to travel.
_You do look, my son, in a moved sort._ Seymour suggests a
transposition: 'you do, my son, look in a moved sort.'"
5080,"I am not I if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay."
5081,"Who’s there?
Nay, answer me.
Stand and unfold yourself."
5082,"A room in Polonius’s house.
Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo."
5083,"Yea, is the worst well?
Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely."
5084,"Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England, and unfold
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accurs’d!"
5085,"_Mir._ Why speaks my father so ungently?
This
Is the third man that e'er I saw; the first                        445
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!"
5086,"Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeo’s name."
5087,"O Banquo, Banquo!
Our royal master’s murder’d!
Woe, alas!"
5088,"Whither to supper?
To our house.
My master’s.
Indeed I should have ask’d you that before."
5089,"Send for the County, go tell him of this.
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning."
5090,"Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Perpend,
I have a daughter—have whilst she is mine—
Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath given me this."
5091,"I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
When in a wood of Crete they bay’d the bear
With hounds of Sparta."
5092,"I have lost myself; I am not here.
This is not Romeo, he’s some other where."
5093,"Eyes, look your last.
Arms, take your last embrace!
And, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death."
5094,"Fair love, you faint with wand’ring in the wood.
And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way."
5095,"If she find him not,
To England send him; or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think."
5096,"To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you."
5097,"Before PROSPERO'S cell._
  _Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA._
_Mir._ If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them."
5098,"Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas that love so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof."
5099,"[_Exit._]
JULIET.
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?"
5100,"I pray you, give me leave.
We will, we will.
[_They retire without the door._]
LAERTES."
5101,"When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
With league whose date till death shall never end."
5102,"_Ari._                            Confined together
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;                    10
They cannot budge till your release."
5103,"We found him in the churchyard.
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither."
5104,"He waxes desperate with imagination.
Let’s follow; ’tis not fit thus to obey him."
5105,"Sit, worthy friends.
My lord is often thus,
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well."
5106,"A pox o' your bottle!
this can sack and                75
drinking do."
5107,"Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
And sets a blister there."
5108,"What, in our house?
Too cruel anywhere.—
Dear Duff, I pr’ythee, contradict thyself,
And say it is not so."
5109,"Be as ourself in Denmark.
Madam, come;
This gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks today
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder."
5110,"Am I like such a fellow?
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as
soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved."
5111,"I’ll to England.
To Ireland, I.
Our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer."
5112,"250: _to_] F1.
_by_ F2 F3 F4.
_Keep_] _Sleep_ Johnson conj."
5113,"Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
Enter Lion and Moonshine."
5114,"Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night,
That if again this apparition come
He may approve our eyes and speak to it."
5115,"Who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."
